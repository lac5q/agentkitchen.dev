## Phase Details

### Phase 34: Universal REST API + Canonical Agent Registry
**Goal**: Any agent (A2A or otherwise) registers against a single canonical model and reports liveness, skills, memory, and tool outcomes through framework-agnostic REST endpoints — with zero hardcoded agents in source.
**Depends on**: v1.7 shipped (Phase 33)
**Requirements**: REST-01, REST-02, REST-03, REST-04, REST-05, REST-06, REG-00, REG-01, REG-02, REG-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A non-A2A client (e.g. `curl`) can register an agent, post a heartbeat, and the agent appears in the Kitchen UI Agent Registry page
  2. The registry page lists every registered agent with capabilities, status, last heartbeat, and protocol type; the user can deregister from the UI
  3. All REST endpoints (`/api/heartbeat`, `/api/skills/report`, `/api/memory/add`, `/api/tool-attention/record`) reject requests with missing or invalid per-agent API keys
  4. Source contains zero hardcoded agent identifiers — the Flow page roster is sourced from the canonical registry DB
  5. A2A registration (Phase 35) and UI registration both write through the same canonical registry service (REG-00 contract verified by tests)
**Plans**: 3/3 complete
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 35: A2A Protocol Implementation + Google ADK Support
**Goal**: Kitchen speaks A2A v1 natively — exposes an agent card, accepts A2A task lifecycle calls, discovers and delegates to registered A2A agents, and a Google ADK agent appears in Flow after registering via A2A.
**Depends on**: Phase 34 (canonical registry must exist before A2A registration adapter)
**Requirements**: A2A-01, A2A-02, A2A-03, A2A-04, A2A-05, A2A-06, A2A-07, A2A-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `GET /.well-known/agent.json` returns a valid A2A agent card with name, description, capabilities, config-derived endpoint URLs, and security scheme
  2. A Google ADK agent registers via A2A and appears as a node in the Flow diagram with declared capabilities
  3. Kitchen accepts `tasks/send`, `tasks/get`, and `tasks/cancel` calls (verified against the A2A v1 spec) and streams progress via SSE
  4. Kitchen can list registered A2A agents via discovery and successfully delegate a task to one of them
  5. Unauthenticated and unauthorized A2A task requests are rejected per the security scheme declared in the agent card
  6. Kitchen's A2A card, remote-agent registration, ADK fixture, and delegation client use config-derived base URLs/ports/network policy instead of hardcoded localhost assumptions
**Plans**: 4/4 complete
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 36: LangGraph Orchestration Service (Python, Checkpoint + HIL)
**Goal**: A separate Python LangGraph service routes inbound tasks to registered agents by capability, persists checkpoints to its own SQLite DB, retries on failure, and surfaces human-in-the-loop approve/reject prompts in the Kitchen UI.
**Depends on**: Phase 35 (A2A transport layer in place; LangGraph owns routing policy on top)
**Requirements**: ORCH-01, ORCH-02, ORCH-03, ORCH-04, ORCH-05, ORCH-06, ORCH-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A task sent to Kitchen routes through LangGraph to a registered agent based on declared capability, and the chosen agent executes it
  2. LangGraph checkpoints persist to a dedicated `data/orchestration.db` (separate from Kitchen's main SQLite DB) — verified by inspecting the file and confirming no cross-process lock contention
  3. A graph node configured for HIL pauses execution and shows a pending approve/reject decision in the Kitchen UI; user approval resumes the graph from checkpoint
  4. A correlation ID generated at task ingress is attached at every hop (Kitchen → LangGraph → agent A → agent B) and is queryable end-to-end
  5. A failing agent task is retried up to N times before surfacing as a failed HIL decision; the A2A adapter / LangGraph boundary contract (ORCH-07) is documented and respected by the implementation
**Plans**: 2/2 complete
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 37: Unified Memory — mem0 Graph Layer + Neo4j
**Goal**: Kitchen exposes one memory API covering all three tiers — vector (Qdrant Cloud), graph (Neo4j via mem0), episodic (SQLite) — with explicit routing rules and a health panel showing all tiers green.
**Depends on**: Phase 34 (`/api/memory/add` already framework-agnostic from REST baseline)
**Requirements**: MEM-01, MEM-02, MEM-03, MEM-04, MEM-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `POST /api/memory/add` with `type=graph` writes to Neo4j via mem0's graph layer; `type=vector` writes to Qdrant Cloud; `type=episodic` writes to SQLite
  2. `GET /api/memory/search` returns semantic-similarity hits from Qdrant Cloud
  3. `GET /api/memory/graph` returns entity and relationship results from Neo4j
  4. The memory health panel in Kitchen UI shows status, document/node counts, and last write time for all three tiers (vector, graph, episodic) — all green when services are reachable
  5. Routing rules for which writes go to which tier are documented and validated by tests
**Plans**: 1/1 complete
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 38: Operating Profiles + Docker Full-Stack
**Goal**: Every port, path, key, backend URL, public base URL, and service topology choice is env/profile-driven; the default profile works out-of-the-box, custom profiles are documented, and `docker-compose up` brings the full OSS stack (Kitchen + Knowledge MCP + mem0 + Neo4j + Pipecat voice + LangGraph orchestration) to a healthy state with Qdrant configured via env to its cloud endpoint.
**Depends on**: Phase 37 (Neo4j must exist as a service to compose)
**Requirements**: INFRA-01, INFRA-02, INFRA-03, INFRA-04, PROFILE-01, PROFILE-02, PROFILE-03, PROFILE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `.env.example` enumerates every port, path, API key, and backend URL used in source — a grep audit confirms zero hardcoded values
  2. `docker-compose up` on a clean machine brings all six services healthy (health endpoints reachable) with Qdrant reachable as a cloud endpoint, never a local container
  3. Pipecat voice service starts in compose using only `.env` values (Gemini API key, port, Kitchen base URL)
  4. `setup.sh` validates Qdrant Cloud connectivity (URL + API key) at startup and fails with a clear actionable error when misconfigured
  5. Operators can select or customize `local-dev`, `single-host`, `private-network`, `cloud-https`, or `custom` install profiles without changing application source

**Plans**: 1/1 complete

### Phase 39: Developer Setup Experience
**Goal**: A new contributor can clone the repo on a fresh machine and reach a working Kitchen with one registered agent through `setup.sh` plus a guided first-run wizard.
**Depends on**: Phase 38 (compose + env baseline must be in place)
**Requirements**: DEV-01, DEV-02, PROFILE-01, PROFILE-02, PROFILE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `./setup.sh` on a fresh machine detects missing prereqs (Node, Python, Docker), scaffolds `.env` from `.env.example`, and starts all services without manual intervention
  2. The first-run wizard guides the user through entering required API keys, registering their first agent, and running an end-to-end health check that passes
  3. Setup presents the recommended default profile first, while allowing an operator to choose or customize topology-specific values for multi-machine use
**Plans**: 1/1 complete
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 40: Documentation + Architecture Diagrams
**Goal**: A new OSS user can follow the README quickstart and have an agent connected to Kitchen in under ten minutes; integration paths for every supported framework and the memory architecture are fully documented.
**Depends on**: Phase 39 (setup experience must be stable to be documented)
**Requirements**: DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-03, DOCS-04, DOCS-05, DOCS-06, DOCS-07, DOCS-08, PROFILE-02, PROFILE-03, PROFILE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A new user following the README quickstart on a fresh machine has an agent connected to Kitchen in under 10 minutes
  2. The architecture diagram covers the A2A hub, three memory tiers, LangGraph orchestration layer, and supported agent frameworks
  3. Per-framework integration guides exist for Claude Code (A2A), Google ADK (A2A), LangGraph (A2A + L↔L delegation), and CrewAI/AutoGen (REST shim)
  4. REST API reference documents every endpoint with auth and request/response examples
  5. Memory architecture guide explains the three tiers, routing rules, when to use each, and the Neo4j schema
  6. Documentation explains supported operating profiles, how to override defaults, and when to choose private-network versus HTTPS deployment
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

### Phase 41: OSS Polish
**Goal**: The repo is ready for public release — licensed, contributable, with security policy, issue templates, and a public CI that runs typecheck, lint, tests, and a Docker compose smoke on every PR.
**Depends on**: Phase 40 (docs land before public CI gates them)
**Requirements**: OSS-01, OSS-02, OSS-03, OSS-04, OSS-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Repo contains an MIT `LICENSE` file at root
  2. `CONTRIBUTING.md` covers setup, branch conventions, PR process, and coding standards
  3. `SECURITY.md` documents the security policy and responsible disclosure process
  4. GitHub bug-report and feature-request issue templates exist
  5. GitHub Actions CI runs typecheck, lint, unit/integration tests, and a Docker compose smoke test on every PR — all green on main
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 42: Response Caching Layer
**Goal**: Add a multi-tier caching layer to eliminate redundant work across the Kitchen stack — API route response caching, MCP query result caching, memory lookup caching, and Neo4j graph query caching — with configurable TTLs, cache invalidation hooks, and a cache health dashboard.
**Depends on**: Phase 41 (OSS polish baseline; caching built on stable APIs)
**Requirements**: CACHE-01, CACHE-02, CACHE-03, CACHE-04, CACHE-05, CACHE-06, CACHE-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Next.js API routes (`/api/heartbeat`, `/api/skills/report`, `/api/tool-attention/*`, `/api/memory/search`) use in-memory LRU cache with configurable TTL (default 30s for heartbeat, 5m for skills/tools, 15m for memory search)
  2. Knowledge MCP search and discover results cached by query hash; cache invalidates when the knowledge index updates (file watch or qmd signal)
  3. mem0 memory recall responses cached by (query, agent_id, collection) tuple; cache clears on memory write via `POST /api/memory/add`
  4. Neo4j graph queries cached with tag-based invalidation — any mutation to the graph layer invalidates related cache entries
  5. A2A task status responses cached per task ID; invalidated on status transition (pending -> running -> complete/failed)
  6. Cache health endpoint (`GET /api/cache/stats`) returns hit/miss ratios, entry counts, and memory usage per cache tier
  7. Cache UI panel on Kitchen Floor shows real-time hit rates, stale entries, and manual purge controls per tier
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 43: Query Performance + Cold Start Elimination
**Goal**: Measure and eliminate slow cold starts across the stack — pre-warm caches on server start, optimize SQLite FTS5 queries, add query plan analysis, and establish performance budgets with automated regression detection.
**Depends on**: Phase 42 (caching layer in place before measuring remaining bottlenecks)
**Requirements**: PERF-01, PERF-02, PERF-03, PERF-04, PERF-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Server startup pre-warms all caches (registry, skills catalog, tool attention catalog, memory health) within 5s of process start
  2. All API routes respond under 200ms p95 when cache-hit, under 500ms p95 on cache-miss (measured via middleware instrumentation)
  3. SQLite FTS5 recall queries use explicit index hints; EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN verified for top 10 recall patterns
  4. LangGraph orchestration state checkpoints use indexed correlation_id lookups (no full table scan)
  5. Performance regression CI step runs on every PR — compares p95 latencies against baseline, fails if any route degrades >20%
**Plans**: TBD

## Backlog

### v2.1+ Ideas (deferred from v2.0)

- [ ] **Phase 42: Response Caching Layer** — LRU cache for API routes, MCP queries, memory lookups, Neo4j graph queries, A2A task status; TTLs; tag-based invalidation; health endpoint + UI
- [ ] **Phase 43: Query Performance + Cold Start Elimination** — Pre-warm on startup, FTS5 optimization, performance budgets, CI regression detection
- [ ] HIL edit-and-continue semantics (modify task state before resuming graph)
- HIL timeout and escalation policies
- Multi-hop retry compensation and rollback
- Memory backend pluggability (beyond mem0 + Qdrant + Neo4j) — v3.0 concern
- Voice meeting bot (Pipecat as meeting participant)
- Flow trigger button (`qmd update` from UI)
- Library freshness indicator (QMD index recency vs file mtime)
- LLM-powered recall scoring upgrade (embedding over BM25)
- Cross-project recall (similar-task recommendations across repos)

### Phase 999.1: Model Choosing Optimization with Agent Kitchen (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Build a model-routing knowledge workspace in Agent Kitchen that tracks task type, model used, cost, quality score, latency, and success rate across all agents. Agents query it before picking a model (`knowledge_workspace_call(workspace="model-routing", action="recommend", ...)`) and append results after each task. The wiki compiles a browsable `topics/model-selection-guide.md`. Over time this gives agents data-driven model selection instead of hardcoded defaults.

**Scope:**
- Source file: `sources/model-routing-log.md` in knowledge repo — agents append task outcomes
- New workspace: `model-routing` with `recommend` action (cost/quality/latency tradeoffs)
- Wiki compilation: `topics/model-selection-guide.md` synthesized routing guide
- MCP tool integration: `knowledge_workspace_call` pattern for pre-task model recommendation
- Dashboard: model usage heat map, cost-per-task trends, quality scores by model

**Depends on:** v2.0 A2A Hub (Phase 41) — needs unified agent registry to attribute routing logs

Run `/gsd-new-milestone` to formally scope v2.1.
