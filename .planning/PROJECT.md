# Project: Agent Kitchen

*Last updated: 2026-05-05 — v2.0 operating profiles captured*

## Current Milestone: v2.0 A2A Hub — Open Source

**Goal:** Transform Kitchen from a personal agent dashboard into an open-source A2A protocol hub with a unified three-tier memory architecture that any agent framework can plug into.

**Target features:**
- A2A Hub — `/.well-known/agent.json`, A2A task API, agent discovery & delegation
- Google ADK support — ADK agents register via A2A, surface in Flow
- Universal REST API — Framework-agnostic heartbeat, skills, memory, tool-attention endpoints
- Unified Memory — mem0 graph layer + Neo4j; unified `/api/memory/*` covering vector (Qdrant Cloud) + graph (Neo4j) + episodic (SQLite)
- Operating profiles + env-driven config — Sane default install, plus documented overrides for ports, paths, URLs, services, auth, and multi-machine topology
- Docker full-stack — `docker-compose up` for OSS users (Kitchen + Knowledge MCP + mem0 + Neo4j; Qdrant stays cloud)
- Documentation — README rewrite, architecture diagram, per-framework guides, API reference, memory architecture guide
- OSS polish — MIT license, CONTRIBUTING.md, security policy, issue templates, public CI

## What This Is

An open-source A2A protocol hub and agent operations dashboard. Kitchen speaks Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol natively — any A2A-compatible agent (Google ADK, Claude Code, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen) plugs in automatically; non-A2A agents get a thin REST shim. It ships with a unified three-tier memory architecture (vector via Qdrant Cloud, graph via Neo4j, episodic via SQLite) and a Next.js dashboard that makes every agent, knowledge system, and skill visible, connected, and self-improving.

Kitchen should operate like a product with a recommended install path, not a personal repo full of hidden assumptions. The default profile should be excellent for local development, while `single-host`, `private-network`, `cloud-https`, and `custom` profiles let operators adapt ports, paths, service URLs, public base URLs, auth mode, and machine layout without changing source.

## Core Value

Any agent framework plugs into Kitchen — and every agent, knowledge system, and skill becomes visible, connected, and self-improving.

### Active (v2.0)

- [ ] A2A Hub: `/.well-known/agent.json` agent card + A2A task API
- [ ] A2A Hub: agent discovery and delegation
- [ ] Google ADK agent registration via A2A, surfaced in Flow
- [ ] Universal REST API: `/api/heartbeat`, `/api/skills/report`, `/api/memory/add`, `/api/tool-attention/record`
- [ ] Dynamic agent roster (remove all hardcoding)
- [ ] Unified memory: mem0 graph layer activated with Neo4j backend
- [ ] Unified memory: `/api/memory/*` API covering vector + graph + episodic tiers
- [ ] Operating profiles: default local install plus customizable `single-host`, `private-network`, `cloud-https`, and `custom` topologies
- [ ] Env-driven config: `.env.example` covering all ports, paths, keys, URLs, backends, and profile-specific values
- [ ] Docker full-stack: Kitchen + Knowledge MCP + mem0 + Neo4j (Qdrant stays cloud)
- [ ] Developer setup: `setup.sh`, prereq detection, first-run wizard
- [ ] Documentation: README rewrite, architecture diagram, per-framework integration guides
- [ ] OSS polish: MIT license, CONTRIBUTING.md, security policy, issue templates, public CI

### Deferred (v2.1+ candidates)

- [ ] Flow trigger button — kick off `qmd update` pipeline from Kitchen UI
- [ ] Library freshness — show QMD index recency timestamp vs file mtime
- [ ] LLM-powered recall scoring — semantic/embedding upgrade to BM25 lexical recall
- [ ] Cross-project recall — similar-task recommendations across multiple local repos
- [ ] Voice meeting bot — Pipecat meeting participant writing transcripts to SQLite with Kitchen highlights panel
- [ ] ClaudeClaw-inspired Chat tab — dedicated command/chat workspace for CLIs, Paperclip project agents, runtime subagents, and Kitchen system identities, separate from Flow
- [ ] Memory search surface — unified search across SQLite recall, mem0/vector memory, Neo4j graph memory, and knowledge files with filters for agent, project, source, date, and tier
- [ ] Schedules and routines console — visible recurring jobs, cron health, standing delegations, maintenance routines, and approval-required automations
- [ ] Hivemind Obsidian view — graph/canvas exploration of agents, memories, tasks, proposals, skills, backlinks, and relationships inspired by Obsidian/ClaudeClaw
- [ ] Paperclip design-system completion — migrate drawers, sheets, modals, detail panels, empty states, and error states off the older dark dashboard shell
- [ ] Memory pluggability beyond mem0+Qdrant+Neo4j (v3.0 concern)

### Out of Scope

- Mobile app — web-first, desktop dashboard
- Multi-user auth — single-user local tool (for now; OSS users run their own instance)
- GitNexus embeddings — blocked by node-llama-cpp macOS arm64 bug (abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#824)
- Memory backend pluggability — mem0 + Qdrant Cloud + Neo4j is the fixed stack; swappability is v3.0
- Local Qdrant in Docker — Qdrant stays cloud; env-configured via `QDRANT_URL` + `QDRANT_API_KEY`

## Context

**Tech stack:** Next.js (App Router), React Flow, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vitest  
**Codebase:** ~21,800 LOC TypeScript/TSX + Python across `apps/kitchen/src/` and `services/`  
**Production:** Port 3002, `npm start`, LaunchAgent auto-start, Cloudflare tunnel  
**Known debt:**
- GitNexus embeddings partial (285/473) — crash bug upstream
- Library freshness indicator reflects file mtime, not QMD index recency
- Turbopack NFT warning traces `/api/apo` through `next.config.ts` during production build

## Constraints

- No `execSync`/`exec` — use `execFileSync` or `fs/promises` only
- No recursive `readdir` on Obsidian vault (518+ files, catastrophic inode load)
- Obsidian heartbeat: stat 3-5 known paths only
- Production server: `npm start` on port 3002 — never `npm run dev`
- mem0 collection `agent_memory`: read-only from app — writes via mem0 HTTP API only
