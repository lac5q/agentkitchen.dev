# Phase 31 Plan 01 — Kitchen Tool Gateway Operations UI: Summary

## Status

Complete.

## Outcome

All three UI requirements were delivered as part of Phase 32 Plan 04 execution
on 2026-05-04 by the remote CCR agent session.

## What Was Delivered

### UIGW-01 — Outcome score badges
Outcome score badges added to each capability card in `ToolAttentionPanel`.
Color-coded by score tier (green ≥ 3, yellow ≥ 0, red < 0).

### UIGW-02 — Context filter inputs
Collapsible "Task Context" form added to the Cookbooks page with four inputs:
task_type, repo, agent_id, tags. Drives both `useToolAttention` and
`useSimilarTaskRecommendations` query parameters in real time.

### UIGW-03 — SimilarTaskPanel
New `SimilarTaskPanel` component renders context-ranked tool recommendations
below the existing `ToolAttentionPanel` on the Cookbooks page.

## Implementation Location

`apps/kitchen/src/components/cookbooks/similar-task-panel.tsx`
`apps/kitchen/src/app/cookbooks/page.tsx`
`apps/kitchen/src/lib/api-client.ts` (`useSimilarTaskRecommendations`)
`apps/kitchen/src/app/api/tool-attention/similar/route.ts`
