# Phase 36 Code Review

**Scope:** Phase 36 orchestration service, Kitchen proxy routes, and HIL UI.
**Status:** No open findings after fixes.

## Findings Fixed

### [P1] Require authorization for HIL listing

`GET /api/orchestration/hil` exposed pending approval task summaries without operator authorization. This matters for private-network or cloud deployments because HIL payloads can include sensitive operational work. Fixed by reusing the Phase 34 operator gate and adding a regression test for unauthorized listing.

### [P2] Support package-style FastAPI imports on Python 3.9

`services/orchestration/app.py` initially depended on direct `from engine import ...` and Pydantic evaluation of `str | None`, which failed when importing `services.orchestration.app` under Python 3.9. Fixed with package/direct import fallback and `Optional[...]` DTO annotations. Verified with an import smoke test.

### [P1] Resume LangGraph checkpoints on reject decisions

Reject originally updated service-level HIL state without resuming the LangGraph interrupt, leaving a paused checkpoint behind. Fixed so both `approve` and `reject` call `LangGraphRuntime.resume(...)`, with a regression test proving rejected graph state reaches `status: rejected`.

## Final Reviewer Verdict

No remaining review findings in the Phase 36 diff. Residual risk is operational: the local Python 3.9 environment emits a LibreSSL warning from `urllib3` while importing LangGraph dependencies, so Phase 38 Docker/setup should use a modern Python/OpenSSL image.
