# Requirements: Agent Kitchen v2.0

**Defined:** 2026-05-04
**Core Value:** Any agent framework plugs into Kitchen — and every agent, knowledge system, and skill becomes visible, connected, and self-improving.

## v2.0 Requirements

### A2A Protocol

- [ ] **A2A-01**: Kitchen exposes `/.well-known/agent.json` agent card with name, description, capabilities, and endpoint URLs
- [ ] **A2A-02**: Kitchen implements A2A v1 task API with correct spec method names (`tasks/send`, `tasks/get`, `tasks/cancel` verified against A2A v1 spec)
- [ ] **A2A-03**: External agent can register with Kitchen via A2A protocol
- [ ] **A2A-04**: Kitchen can discover registered A2A agents and their declared capabilities
- [ ] **A2A-05**: Kitchen can delegate tasks to registered A2A agents
- [ ] **A2A-06**: Google ADK agents register via A2A and appear as nodes in Flow diagram
- [ ] **A2A-07**: A2A task progress streams via SSE (server-sent events)
- [ ] **A2A-08**: A2A endpoints enforce agent identity and per-task authorization (security scheme defined in agent card)

### Universal REST API

- [ ] **REST-01**: Any agent can `POST /api/heartbeat` to report liveness (framework-agnostic)
- [ ] **REST-02**: Any agent can `POST /api/skills/report` to report skill usage
- [ ] **REST-03**: Any agent can `POST /api/memory/add` to write to unified memory
- [ ] **REST-04**: Any agent can `POST /api/tool-attention/record` to log tool outcomes
- [ ] **REST-05**: Dynamic agent roster — registered agents stored in DB, zero hardcoding in source
- [ ] **REST-06**: Per-agent API key authentication enforced on all REST endpoints

### Agent Registry

- [ ] **REG-00**: Single canonical agent registry model (DB schema + service layer) — A2A registration, REST registration, and UI registration are all adapters onto this model
- [ ] **REG-01**: Agent registry page in Kitchen UI listing all registered agents (A2A and REST shim)
- [ ] **REG-02**: Each agent entry displays capabilities, status, last heartbeat, and protocol type
- [ ] **REG-03**: User can register and deregister agents from Kitchen UI

### Orchestration (LangGraph)

- [ ] **ORCH-01**: Python LangGraph service with StateGraph for task routing between registered agents
- [ ] **ORCH-02**: Checkpoint persistence via SqliteSaver writing to a dedicated `data/orchestration.db` (separate from Kitchen's main SQLite DB to avoid cross-process lock contention)
- [ ] **ORCH-03**: Human-in-the-loop (v2.0 scope: approve/reject only) — Kitchen UI shows pending HIL decisions; user approves or rejects and graph resumes from checkpoint
- [ ] **ORCH-04**: Capability-based routing — incoming tasks matched to agents by declared capability
- [ ] **ORCH-05**: Correlation IDs and task lineage — every hop (Kitchen → LangGraph → agent A → agent B) carries a trace ID, persisted end-to-end
- [ ] **ORCH-06**: Basic retry policy — failed agent tasks retried up to N times before rerouting or surfacing as failed HIL decision
- [ ] **ORCH-07**: A2A adapter / LangGraph boundary contract — A2A adapter owns transport, protocol, and task state mapping; LangGraph owns routing policy, capability selection, retry, and HIL; they communicate via internal API

### Unified Memory

- [ ] **MEM-01**: mem0 graph layer activated with Neo4j as backend
- [ ] **MEM-02**: `POST /api/memory/add` routes writes to correct tier based on explicit routing rules (vector for semantic facts, graph for entity relationships, episodic for conversation/event logs)
- [ ] **MEM-03**: `GET /api/memory/search` — semantic similarity search against Qdrant Cloud (vector tier)
- [ ] **MEM-04**: `GET /api/memory/graph` — entity and relationship queries against Neo4j (graph tier)
- [ ] **MEM-05**: Memory tier health panel in Kitchen UI showing status, document/node counts, and last write time for each tier (vector, graph, episodic)

### Infrastructure

- [ ] **INFRA-01**: `.env.example` covers every port, path, API key, and backend URL — zero hardcoded values in application source
- [ ] **INFRA-02**: `docker-compose.yml` spins Kitchen + Knowledge MCP + mem0 + Neo4j + Pipecat voice service + LangGraph orchestration service in one command (Qdrant stays cloud, configured via env)
- [ ] **INFRA-03**: Pipecat voice service fully env-configured (Gemini API key, service port, Kitchen base URL all via `.env`)
- [ ] **INFRA-04**: `setup.sh` validates Qdrant Cloud connectivity and API key at startup — fails fast with a clear actionable error if not configured

### Developer Setup

- [ ] **DEV-01**: `setup.sh` detects missing prereqs (Node, Python, Docker), scaffolds `.env` from `.env.example`, and starts all services
- [ ] **DEV-02**: First-run wizard — guided setup for required API keys, first agent registration, and end-to-end health check

### Documentation

- [ ] **DOCS-01**: README rewrite — what Kitchen is, 5-minute quickstart, architecture overview, when to use A2A vs REST shim
- [ ] **DOCS-02**: Architecture diagram — A2A hub, memory tiers (vector/graph/episodic), LangGraph orchestration layer, supported agent frameworks
- [ ] **DOCS-03**: Integration guide — Claude Code agents (A2A path)
- [ ] **DOCS-04**: Integration guide — Google ADK agents (A2A path)
- [ ] **DOCS-05**: Integration guide — LangGraph agents (A2A path + LangGraph-to-LangGraph delegation)
- [ ] **DOCS-06**: Integration guide — CrewAI and AutoGen agents (REST shim path)
- [ ] **DOCS-07**: REST API reference — all endpoints, authentication, request/response examples
- [ ] **DOCS-08**: Memory architecture guide — three tiers, routing rules, when to use each, Neo4j schema

### OSS Polish

- [ ] **OSS-01**: MIT `LICENSE` file
- [ ] **OSS-02**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` — setup, branch conventions, PR process, coding standards
- [ ] **OSS-03**: `SECURITY.md` — security policy and responsible disclosure process
- [ ] **OSS-04**: GitHub issue templates — bug report and feature request
- [ ] **OSS-05**: GitHub Actions CI — typecheck, lint, unit/integration tests, Docker compose smoke test on every PR

## Deferred to v2.1+

- HIL edit-and-continue semantics (modify task state before resuming graph)
- HIL timeout and escalation policies
- Multi-hop retry compensation and rollback
- Memory backend pluggability (beyond mem0 + Qdrant + Neo4j)
- Voice meeting bot (Pipecat as meeting participant)
- Flow trigger button (`qmd update` from UI)
- Library freshness indicator (QMD index recency vs file mtime)
- LLM-powered recall scoring upgrade (embedding over BM25)
- Cross-project recall (similar-task recommendations across repos)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Local Qdrant in Docker compose | Qdrant stays cloud; env-configured via `QDRANT_URL` + `QDRANT_API_KEY` |
| Memory backend pluggability | Fixed stack for v2.0; swappability is v3.0 |
| Multi-user auth | Single-user local tool; OSS users run their own instance |
| Mobile app | Web-first desktop dashboard |
| GitNexus embeddings | Blocked by upstream node-llama-cpp macOS arm64 bug |
