# Requirements: Memroos v5.0 — Memory Trust + Operational Intelligence

*Created: 2026-05-17 | Updated: 2026-05-23 — v5.0 requirements added*

---

## v5.0 Requirements

### Memory Security Foundation

- [x] **MEMSEC-01**: Raw agentic conversations and imported context are stored in an append-only raw evidence vault (`~/.memroos/vault/<tenant>/`), not primarily as large plaintext SQLite rows. The vault supports compressed per-session or per-day artifacts, content hashes, replay metadata, retention policy, tenant/project/source metadata, classification labels, and encryption key ids. Verified Phase 74.
- [x] **MEMSEC-02**: Security labels are represented as independent dimensions across `visibility`, `domain`, `sensitivity`, and `policy`, with at least `private/internal/public_safe/public_approved`, `legal/finance/hr/client/personal/engineering`, `pii/secret/credential/privileged/contract/payment/health`, and `indexable/agent_visible/requires_redaction/requires_human_review/sealed` support. Verified Phase 74.
- [x] **MEMSEC-03**: Ingestion and classification are fail-closed: raw meetings, emails, DMs, browser history, files, finance, legal, HR, personal, and client sources default to private; deterministic detectors run before constrained LLM adjudication; uncertain, conflicting, public-promotion, legal, finance, HR, credential, payment, privileged, and sealed cases route to human review. Verified Phase 75.
- [x] **MEMSEC-04**: Retrieval and use authorization is enforced before every memory search, multi-search, context-pack assembly, ChatGPT action, export, summarization, agent dispatch, FTS/vector/graph index write, and derived evidence bundle. The policy decision checks actor identity, role, capability, tenant/project, purpose, source freshness, and security labels, then returns allow, deny, redact, or review-required. Verified Phase 76.
- [x] **MEMSEC-05**: Derived indexes are classification-aware. FTS, semantic embeddings, Qdrant/vector memory, Neo4j/graph facts, qmd projections, and evidence bundles only receive content where `indexable=true`; restricted content remains unindexed or uses an approved redacted projection with provenance back to the raw artifact. Verified Phase 77.
- [x] **MEMSEC-06**: Multimodal storage starts with text-first embeddings from transcripts, OCR, captions, and normalized text chunks; original binary media stays in the raw vault. Every embedding stores artifact id, source span, modality, model name/version, dimension, label version, and creation timestamp, and embeddings inherit the source security label unless explicitly redacted and approved. Verified Phase 77.
- [x] **MEMSEC-07**: Sensitive raw artifacts and sensitive JSON/detail fields use app-level envelope encryption with key id metadata, rotation path, and backup/restore verification. OS or volume encryption is required for deployment profiles, while SQLCipher or whole-DB page encryption remains an evaluated defense-in-depth option rather than the primary MVP leak-prevention boundary. Verified Phase 77.
- [x] **MEMSEC-08**: Security regression tests prove restricted memory cannot leak through recall, multi-search, context packs, ChatGPT Actions, exports, summaries, agent dispatch, audit search, or derived indexes. Negative fixtures must cover legal, finance, HR, credential, payment, privileged, personal, confidential, and public-promotion cases. Verified Phase 78.
- [x] **CTX-FOLLOWUP-03**: Privacy classification policy spike: design a governed classifier cascade for meetings, emails, DMs, files, and imported context that defaults raw data to private, separates visibility/domain/sensitivity/policy labels, runs deterministic PII/secret/legal/finance/source-metadata gates before constrained LLM adjudication, requires evidence spans and abstention for uncertain labels, eval-gates public promotion against golden sets, and routes legal/finance/credential/public conflicts to human review. Verified Phase 75.

### Context Source Reliability + Sink Health

- [x] **CTX-FOLLOWUP-01**: Context-source contract coverage extends beyond the Phase 69 starter set: every configured source family used by operators (including Drive, Slack, Gmail/Spark, local folders, qmd, mem0, and future connectors) declares ingest, index, freshness, safe-answer, and repair behavior with no silent unindexed lanes. Verified Phase 80 via declarative cron/source health registry baseline.
- [x] **CTX-FOLLOWUP-02**: Runtime health reports memory degradation paths, not just service reachability: queued writes, retry backlog, stale semantic recall, replay verification, and source-to-QMD indexing proof must be visible to operators and evals. Verified Phase 80 via caught-up/warning cron health and NOC contract surfacing.
- [x] **CRON-HEALTH-01**: Recurring cron jobs ("sinks") that perform data ingestion, memory writes, or external API polling must expose a health status endpoint or heartbeat that the MemroOS dashboard can consume. Verified Phase 80.
- [x] **CRON-HEALTH-02**: The schedules and routines console must surface per-job last-run timestamp, success/failure status, items processed, and any warnings or caught-up status. Verified Phase 80 API contract.
- [x] **CRON-HEALTH-03**: Jobs that are not caught up must emit a warning-level health signal that appears in the NOC and/or operator notification surface. Verified Phase 80 and `/api/operations/noc`.
- [x] **CRON-HEALTH-04**: Operators must be able to pause, resume, or stop individual cron jobs from the dashboard without restarting the entire MemroOS runtime. Verified Phase 80 API mutation.
- [x] **CRON-HEALTH-05**: Job definitions must be declarative (stored in a config or registry) so that the health monitoring surface knows what jobs *should* exist and can detect missing or orphaned schedules. Verified Phase 80.
- [x] **UX-FOLLOWUP-03**: Schedules and routines console exposes recurring jobs, cron health, standing delegations, maintenance routines, and approval-required automations. Verified Phase 80 backend contract; UI polish remains future enhancement.

### Operations NOC Real-Data

- [x] **NOC-01**: Operations NOC must not render hardcoded sample values for any panel. Production `components/operations/*` panels must consume live data through a unified `/api/operations/noc` contract or existing React Query hooks; mock constants may only remain in tests, development fixtures, or explicitly labeled demos. Verified Phase 79.
- [x] **NOC-02**: Operations NOC data contract exposes per-panel provenance: `source`, `lastUpdated`, `window`, `status=live|empty|degraded|missing`, and `warnings`; missing/degraded telemetry must render honestly instead of fabricated metrics. Verified Phase 79.
- [x] **NOC-03**: Pulse strip derives tasks completed, active dispatches, memory reads, spend today, savings vs baseline, and wasted work from live `agents`, `hive`, `activity`, `tokens`, `memory`, and `model-routing` sources, with missing-source callouts where telemetry does not exist. Verified Phase 79 with existing hooks plus `/api/operations/noc` provenance.
- [x] **NOC-04**: Memory consumption and "memory not digested" panels derive from memory consolidation, memory tier health, recall stats/evals, and per-memory access telemetry; if per-memory access telemetry is absent, add it before claiming high-salience memories are unused. Verified Phase 79 with explicit missing telemetry state.
- [x] **NOC-05**: Agent workload panel derives agent names, status, current task, heartbeat, dispatch activity, HIL waits, and failure/retry signals from the canonical registry, local runtime detection, hive actions, orchestration/HIL state, and Paperclip fleet data. Verified Phase 79.
- [x] **NOC-06**: Model utility panel derives model rows from real model usage and model-routing telemetry, including task count, cost, latency, quality score, success rate, and best-fit recommendation. Verified Phase 79.
- [x] **NOC-07**: Skills lifecycle and behavior signals derive from the skills API, contribution history, coverage telemetry status, failure logs, review state, SEAL proposals, model-routing drift, memory evals, and security/audit events; inferred signals must cite source evidence and avoid presenting speculative recommendations as facts. Verified Phase 79 and skill suggestions audit.
- [x] **NOC-08**: Governance strip derives preflight blocks, HIL approvals, tool denials, audit lines, escalations, and recent governance events from live audit, orchestration, security, and escalation APIs. Verified Phase 79.
- [x] **NOC-09**: Engagement console on the NOC home screen uses the canonical agent registry and real chat/dispatch APIs; sending a directive must create a real dispatch/chat action or return a visible error, never a canned interaction. Verified Phase 79 by keeping chat owned by `/dispatch`.
- [x] **NOC-10**: Efficiency signals require new telemetry before being shown as live: retrieval calls before useful work, same-source re-read count, raw-context ingest token share, operator re-ask redundancy, and rediscovered-fact rate. Until those streams exist, the efficiency section must render a missing-telemetry checklist, not sample numbers. Verified Phase 79.
- [x] **NOC-11**: Verification proves the NOC is real-data backed: tests fail if production Operations components import `noc-mock-data`; seeded API tests assert metrics match fixture DB/log inputs; Playwright verifies live, empty, and degraded states; authenticated local/public smoke checks confirm `/` renders live NOC data after deployment. Verified Phase 79.
- [x] **NOC-12**: Every NOC control is actionable. Buttons must either navigate to a real owner surface, mutate visible UI state, trigger an implemented API, or render an explicit missing-backend explanation; no inert controls remain on the NOC. Verified Phase 79.
- [x] **NOC-13**: The NOC home does not embed Engage/chat controls. Engagement belongs on `/dispatch` unless a future requirement wires an inline NOC action to the same real dispatch/chat APIs with full error handling. Verified Phase 79.
- [x] **NOC-14**: NOC-level time-window controls propagate to any live-backed panels; sample-backed panels must label the window as preview-only until the unified `/api/operations/noc` contract exists. Verified Phase 79.
- [x] **OPS-AUDIT-01**: Every application page that renders performance, usage, health, outcome, cost, quality, or failure metrics has a date-range/time-window control, a source/provenance state, loading and error states, and an over-time view when the underlying data supports it. Verified Phase 79 MVP.
- [x] **OPS-AUDIT-02**: Ledger, Business Ops, Skills, Agents, Memory, Governance, Improve, Workflow Map, and Dispatch receive a route-by-route audit for mock data, silent zeros, dead controls, slow-loading queries, and missing action explanations. Verified Phase 79 MVP.
- [x] **OPS-AUDIT-03**: Ledger source availability is explicit: RTK/token stats, Claude model logs, model-routing telemetry, and time-series routes must distinguish live, empty, unavailable, and failed states instead of rendering zeros or blank charts without cause. Verified Phase 79 MVP.
- [x] **OPS-AUDIT-04**: Business Ops timeline and adapter status expose the selected date range, adapter mode, event counts, last poll, empty-state reason, and failed-load details for `/api/evals/history` and `/api/l3/events`. Verified Phase 79.

### Harness Control Plane + Evidence Governance

- [x] **HARN-01**: Full Harness Control Plane: every dispatched task exposes a Plan-Execute-Verify timeline showing context assembled, tools exposed, permissions granted, actions taken, verification run, and memory updated. Stored in `task_evidence_bundles` keyed on `a2a_tasks.task_id`. Verified Phase 81 backend substrate.
- [x] **HARN-02**: Universal evidence bundles: every agent output can show sources used, memories consumed, tools/commands run, checks passed, unverified assumptions, residual risks, and replay/rollback artifacts. Bundles are written asynchronously (fire-and-forget) so agent execution is never blocked. Verified Phase 81.
- [x] **HARN-03**: Shared harness state: tasks declare read/write sets, assumptions, version dependencies, verifier obligations, and conflict policy; stale belief/context drift is surfaced before action. Verified Phase 81 bundle fields.

### Auth + Team Hardening

- [x] **AUTH-FOLLOWUP-01**: Team auth hardening adds email invitation delivery, password reset, email change/verification, OAuth/SSO login (Google, GitHub), and login/refresh lockout telemetry. Verified Phase 82 MVP with invite/password-reset/email-verification/auth-event substrate; provider-backed OAuth remains configuration follow-up.
- [x] **AUTH-FOLLOWUP-02**: Role-aware UI gating hides or disables unauthorized nav/actions before click-through while keeping API/page-level 403 enforcement. Verified Phase 82.
- [x] **AUTH-FOLLOWUP-03**: Tenant/admin management includes API-key rotation, tenant settings, user lifecycle management, and migration of legacy audit actor fields to authenticated user identity. Verified Phase 82 MVP with existing API-key/team surfaces plus auth event tables.

---

## v5.1 Requirements (Completed)

### Memory Inventory + Listing Clarity

- [x] **MEMLIST-01**: Memory-facing UI and API copy must use explicit memory categories instead of a single ambiguous "memories" count. At minimum, surfaces distinguish vector memories, ingested messages, consolidated insights, episodic writes, graph facts, and knowledge files, with definitions available near the count.
- [x] **MEMLIST-02**: The Memory surface exposes an inventory summary that counts each memory category from its canonical source of truth: mem0/Qdrant for vector memories, SQLite `messages` for ingested messages, `memory_meta_insights` for consolidated insights, `agent_memory_writes` for explicit episodic writes, Neo4j/graph health for graph facts, and configured qmd/knowledge collections for knowledge files.
- [x] **MEMLIST-03**: Memory listing rows include provenance and state fields needed to explain why an item appears: tier/category, backend, source connector or agent, project/workspace, timestamp, security label snapshot, consolidation state, salience/access metadata when available, and raw evidence/vault pointer when authorized.
- [x] **MEMLIST-04**: Memory search and list filters let operators narrow by category/tier, backend, agent, project/workspace, source, date range, label dimensions, consolidation state, and degraded source status without mixing knowledge files, raw messages, and durable vector facts in one unlabelled result set.
- [x] **MEMLIST-05**: Memory-count and listing verification includes seeded tests and a live operator smoke that prove no hardcoded demo counts remain, all counts cite a source/provenance timestamp, empty/degraded states are honest, and provider failures such as consolidation `429` errors explain why new insights are not appearing.

## v5.2 Requirements (Completed)

### Competitive Memory Target Architecture

- [x] **MEMTARGET-01**: MemRoOS must carry a reproducible competitive memory target architecture that can be evaluated against public alternatives and verified against the live MemRoOS recall path. The target architecture requires: a public-evidence marketplace benchmark with scored current/target MemRoOS profiles and real alternatives; a documented hard recommendation for the architecture gap; live recall eval hardening for backend-normalized vector IDs, indexable episodic fixtures, deterministic FTS projection, and non-brittle expected-fact retrieval; an npm command that regenerates the marketplace comparison; and a live full-suite recall gate that passes with `passRate=1.0`, no tier failures, and p95 latency below 500ms on the local operator deployment. Verified Phase 84.

## v4.0 Requirements (Completed)

### HIL Enhancements

- [x] **HIL-01**: Operator can modify declared task state fields via a dedicated edit UI before resuming a paused LangGraph thread (70-02 Python endpoint + 70-05 TS route/client/UI complete; live panel parity tracked by `UI-PARITY-02`)
- [x] **HIL-02**: System validates edited field values against `OrchestrationState` schema before accepting the update (70-02 Python validation + 70-05 TS proxy validation complete; live panel parity tracked by `UI-PARITY-02`)
- [x] **HIL-03**: Audit log records who edited a HIL task, which fields changed, and before/after values (70-02 lineage row + 70-05 operator identity proxy complete; live panel parity tracked by `UI-PARITY-02`)
- [x] **HIL-04**: Each HIL interrupt type has a configurable SLA deadline stored as an ISO timestamp
- [x] **HIL-05**: Background scheduler proactively checks for expired HIL tasks every 60s and triggers escalation actions (notify, auto-resolve, or abandon)
- [x] **HIL-06**: Operator can view pending HIL items with countdown timers and SLA traffic-light status in the dashboard (71-04 complete; local DB empty state browser-checked, countdown behavior covered by component tests)

### Orchestration: Multi-Hop Retry + Rollback

- [x] **ORCH-08**: Each hop in a multi-agent chain has a configurable retry budget via LangGraph `RetryPolicy` (70-03 complete; topology closure follow-up tracked by `ORCH-FOLLOWUP-01`)
- [x] **ORCH-09**: Each forward action declares a paired compensating action stored as a declarative row in `orchestration_lineage` (70-03 complete; graph-node/A2A compensation closure tracked by `ORCH-FOLLOWUP-01`)
- [x] **ORCH-10**: A2A task status reflects granular failure state: "failed at hop N, compensated hops 1..N-1" (70-03 complete; graph-node/A2A compensation closure tracked by `ORCH-FOLLOWUP-01`)

### Memory Backend Pluggability

- [x] **MEM-06**: `MemoryAdapter` interface exposes only `search()`, `write()`, and `health()` — no client handle leakage
- [x] **MEM-07**: Adapter registry maps `MemoryTier` to `MemoryAdapter[]`; new backends register without touching existing code
- [x] **MEM-08**: Existing mem0/Qdrant/Neo4j backends wrapped as concrete adapters implementing the interface

### Voice Meeting Bot

- [x] **VOICE-06**: Pipecat meeting bot pipeline joins Daily.co rooms via `DailyTransport` (room URL + token from env/API)
- [x] **VOICE-07**: Real-time transcript per speaker written to `messages` table; meeting highlights surfaced to `hive_actions`
- [x] **VOICE-08**: Meeting URL and join tokens never logged to `audit_log`; recording consent UI shown before joining (71-05 secrets discipline complete; 71-06 consent gate and join UI complete)

### LLM-Powered Recall Scoring

- [x] **RECALL-01**: Recall endpoint supports `mode=semantic|bm25|hybrid`; hybrid merges Ollama `nomic-embed-text` + BM25 via RRF; BM25 remains default; this applies to message recall in `conversations.db` and does not replace qmd BM25 or mem0/Qdrant vector memory (71-01 embedding foundation + 71-02 endpoint modes complete)
- [x] **RECALL-02**: Embeddings precomputed at ingest via background job (50 messages/cycle, 5-min interval); degrades gracefully with `degraded: true` on embedding outage (71-01 store/provider + 71-02 background job complete)

### Cross-Project Recall

- [x] **RECALL-03**: Caller can request cross-project recall by passing `crossProject: true` with explicit `allowed_project_ids`
- [x] **RECALL-04**: Cross-project results ranked by semantic similarity and annotated with source repo; single-project remains default

### True Behavioral W-Lift

- [x] **SEAL-04**: `BehavioralEvalService` implements `EvalServiceLike.rescoreForProposal()` dispatching real agent re-execution via A2A hub
- [x] **SEAL-05**: Behavioral eval uses a sandboxed profile with no-op tool stubs on a held-out 10-20 task sample
- [x] **SEAL-06**: `applyProposal()` returns `job_id` immediately; UI polls for completion; request handler never blocked; completed eval jobs expose evidence bundles with task sample, tools/commands, checks passed, assumptions, residual risks, and replay/rollback handle

### UI: Flow Trigger + Library Freshness

- [x] **UI-05**: Operator can trigger `qmd update` pipeline from the UI with SSE progress streaming
- [x] **UI-06**: Library page shows QMD index recency timestamp vs latest file mtime per collection as context freshness evidence

### Cross-Harness Skills

- [x] **SKILL-01**: `skill_registry` table stores normalized skill definitions imported from Claude/OpenAI/Gemini harnesses (SKILL.md format) with governed contract fields: preconditions, allowed tools, risk tier, verification checks, owner, rollback behavior, and dispatch status
- [x] **SKILL-02**: Operator can import a SKILL.md file and have it normalized and stored in the registry
- [x] **SKILL-03**: A2A dispatcher looks up the skill registry before falling back to per-agent instructions
- [x] **SKILL-04**: Skills UI shows all registered skills, their source harness, dispatch status, and contract completeness

- [ ] **NOC-06**: Model utility panel derives model rows from real model usage and model-routing telemetry, including task count, cost, latency, quality score, success rate, and best-fit recommendation.
- [ ] **NOC-07**: Skills lifecycle and behavior signals derive from the skills API, contribution history, coverage telemetry status, failure logs, review state, SEAL proposals, model-routing drift, memory evals, and security/audit events; inferred signals must cite source evidence and avoid presenting speculative recommendations as facts.
- [ ] **NOC-08**: Governance strip derives preflight blocks, HIL approvals, tool denials, audit lines, escalations, and recent governance events from live audit, orchestration, security, and escalation APIs.
- [ ] **NOC-09**: Engagement console on the NOC home screen uses the canonical agent registry and real chat/dispatch APIs; sending a directive must create a real dispatch/chat action or return a visible error, never a canned interaction.
- [ ] **NOC-10**: Efficiency signals require new telemetry before being shown as live: retrieval calls before useful work, same-source re-read count, raw-context ingest token share, operator re-ask redundancy, and rediscovered-fact rate. Until those streams exist, the efficiency section must render a missing-telemetry checklist, not sample numbers.
- [ ] **NOC-11**: Verification proves the NOC is real-data backed: tests fail if production Operations components import `noc-mock-data`; seeded API tests assert metrics match fixture DB/log inputs; Playwright verifies live, empty, and degraded states; authenticated local/public smoke checks confirm `/` renders live NOC data after deployment.
- [ ] **NOC-12**: Every NOC control is actionable. Buttons must either navigate to a real owner surface, mutate visible UI state, trigger an implemented API, or render an explicit missing-backend explanation; no inert controls remain on the NOC.

- [ ] **OPS-AUDIT-04**: Business Ops timeline and adapter status expose the selected date range, adapter mode, event counts, last poll, empty-state reason, and failed-load details for `/api/evals/history` and `/api/l3/events`.
- [ ] **ORCH-FOLLOWUP-01**: Phase 70 deferred multi-hop topology work is promoted from phase-local debt: add a real `rollback_compensation` LangGraph node, loop through multi-hop chains in graph topology, track per-hop attempts in lineage detail JSON, and dispatch A2A compensation tasks when agents expose `requiredCapability="compensate"`.
- [ ] **ARCH-01**: MemroOS documents and verifies coverage of the agentic AI stack layers: goal, orchestration, agents, tools, memory, monitoring, reliability/failure handling, and governance/security.
- [ ] **ARCH-02**: MemroOS exposes architecture/layer health that reports configured, degraded, and missing capabilities across the agentic stack without requiring operators to infer gaps from scattered panels.
- [ ] **ARCH-03**: Onboarding and setup guide users through the agentic stack layers and their required configuration, not just isolated features.
- [ ] **PRODUCT-01**: Eval Engine product packaging decision: choose whether the 3-layer composite `W` and SEAL self-improvement loop ship only bundled with MemroOS Hub or also as a separately positioned eval/self-improvement product surface.
- [ ] **PRODUCT-02**: Eval Engine commercialization requirements: define pricing axis, trace-ingestion contract, judge-model cost ownership, golden-set marketplace strategy, compliance floor, and competitive framing before expanding the public eval API beyond dogfooding.
- [ ] **VERTICAL-01**: Second vertical candidate backlog: after finance reconciliation has a live customer proof, select healthcare, legal, or ops/logistics as the next adapter + golden-set + UI-terminology vertical without baking vertical logic into the core.
- [ ] **CTX-FOLLOWUP-01**: Context-source contract coverage extends beyond the Phase 69 starter set: every configured source family used by operators (including Drive, Slack, Gmail/Spark, local folders, qmd, mem0, and future connectors) declares ingest, index, freshness, safe-answer, and repair behavior with no silent unindexed lanes.
- [ ] **CTX-FOLLOWUP-02**: Runtime health reports memory degradation paths, not just service reachability: queued writes, retry backlog, stale semantic recall, replay verification, and source-to-QMD indexing proof must be visible to operators and evals.
- [x] **CTX-FOLLOWUP-03**: Privacy classification policy spike: design a governed classifier cascade for meetings, emails, DMs, files, and imported context that defaults raw data to private, separates visibility/domain/sensitivity/policy labels, runs deterministic PII/secret/legal/finance/source-metadata gates before constrained LLM adjudication, requires evidence spans and abstention for uncertain labels, eval-gates public promotion against golden sets, and routes legal/finance/credential/public conflicts to human review. Source note: `.planning/notes/privacy-classification-policy-spike.md`. Verified Phase 75.
- [x] **MEMSEC-01**: Raw agentic conversations and imported context are stored in an append-only raw evidence vault, not primarily as large plaintext SQLite rows. The vault must support compressed per-session or per-day artifacts, content hashes, replay metadata, retention policy, tenant/project/source metadata, classification labels, and encryption key ids. Source note: `.planning/notes/memory-security-storage-spike.md`. Verified Phase 74.
- [x] **MEMSEC-02**: Security labels are represented as independent dimensions across `visibility`, `domain`, `sensitivity`, and `policy`, with at least `private/internal/public_safe/public_approved`, `legal/finance/hr/client/personal/engineering`, `pii/secret/credential/privileged/contract/payment/health`, and `indexable/agent_visible/requires_redaction/requires_human_review/sealed` support. Verified Phase 74.
- [x] **MEMSEC-03**: Ingestion and classification are fail-closed: raw meetings, emails, DMs, browser history, files, finance, legal, HR, personal, and client sources default to private; deterministic detectors run before constrained LLM adjudication; uncertain, conflicting, public-promotion, legal, finance, HR, credential, payment, privileged, and sealed cases route to human review. Verified Phase 75.
- [x] **MEMSEC-04**: Retrieval and use authorization is enforced before every memory search, multi-search, context-pack assembly, ChatGPT action, export, summarization, agent dispatch, FTS/vector/graph index write, and derived evidence bundle. The policy decision must check actor identity, role, capability, tenant/project, purpose, source freshness, and security labels, then return allow, deny, redact, or review-required. Verified Phase 76.
- [ ] **MEMSEC-05**: Derived indexes are classification-aware. FTS, semantic embeddings, Qdrant/vector memory, Neo4j/graph facts, qmd projections, and evidence bundles must only receive content where `indexable=true`; restricted content must remain unindexed or use an approved redacted projection with provenance back to the raw artifact.
- [ ] **MEMSEC-06**: Multimodal storage starts with text-first embeddings from transcripts, OCR, captions, and normalized text chunks; original binary media stays in the raw vault. Every embedding stores artifact id, source span, modality, model name/version, dimension, label version, and creation timestamp, and embeddings inherit the source security label unless explicitly redacted and approved.
- [ ] **MEMSEC-07**: Sensitive raw artifacts and sensitive JSON/detail fields use app-level envelope encryption with key id metadata, rotation path, and backup/restore verification. OS or volume encryption is required for deployment profiles, while SQLCipher or whole-DB page encryption remains an evaluated defense-in-depth option rather than the primary MVP leak-prevention boundary.
- [ ] **MEMSEC-08**: Security regression tests prove restricted memory cannot leak through recall, multi-search, context packs, ChatGPT Actions, exports, summaries, agent dispatch, audit search, or derived indexes. Negative fixtures must cover legal, finance, HR, credential, payment, privileged, personal, confidential, and public-promotion cases.
- [ ] **INT-FOLLOWUP-01**: MemroOS MCP consolidation removes the legacy standalone mem0-only MCP adapter from agent registration paths and routes all memory tools through the unified `memroos` MCP facade. Scope includes `services/memory/mcp-mem0.py`, `services/memory/mcp-mem0-wrapper.sh`, stale `memory_get_all`/`memory_health` capability references, docs/configs, and verification that `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.gemini/mcp.json`, ChatGPT LaunchAgent, and onboarding scripts expose only the unified MemroOS MCP surface.
- [ ] **INT-FOLLOWUP-02**: FastMCP v3.x migration upgrades `services/knowledge-mcp` from `fastmcp>=2,<3` to `fastmcp>=3,<4`, moves server transport/path/stateless/auth options to the v3-compatible runtime API, preserves stdio and Streamable HTTP `/mcp`, and verifies `fastmcp inspect`, `knowledge_health`, `search`, `fetch`, `memory_search`, `memory_save`, `agent_memory_save`, `tool_catalog`, launchd restart, and ChatGPT connector behavior.
- [ ] **INT-FOLLOWUP-03**: Integration dependency modernization audit keeps a source-backed inventory of older integration surfaces before they drift further. The audit output must include current/local versions, current upstream versions, owner, risk rating, migration notes, rollback path, and live probe matrix, and it must route concrete work to the dedicated follow-ups below instead of treating major upgrades as routine package bumps.
- [ ] **INT-FOLLOWUP-04**: `mem0ai` 2.x migration upgrades the memory service from `mem0ai>=0.1,<1.0` to the current 2.x Python SDK, preserving Qdrant/Neo4j config loading, queued-write retry behavior, `/health`, `/memory/add`, `/memory/search`, `/memory/failures`, and the unified MemroOS MCP `memory_search`/`memory_save` tools. Verification must include a real or fixture-backed `Memory.from_config` add/search smoke, queue retry tests, and rollback instructions to the pinned 0.1.x line.
- [ ] **INT-FOLLOWUP-05**: A2A/ADK current-spec compatibility pass validates MemroOS against the current A2A agent-card and messaging spec before new A2A extensions ship. Scope includes `A2A_VERSION`, canonical `/.well-known/agent-card.json`, legacy `/.well-known/agent.json` compatibility policy, HTTP+JSON and JSON-RPC method names, streaming and unsupported-operation behavior, cancel/subscribe semantics, auth/security metadata, Google ADK fixture interop, and an explicit decision on ADK's non-legacy A2A extension mode.
- [ ] **INT-FOLLOWUP-06**: Runtime patch sweep verifies current minor/patch integration drift for Pipecat/Daily, LangGraph/checkpointer, and Next.js 16.2.x proxy behavior. Pipecat/Daily scope covers stale 1.0-era comments/import assumptions, `DailyTransport` listener smokes, transcript frame handling, and room-token redaction. LangGraph scope covers the 1.2.x patch bump, explicit `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite` inventory/security floor, `SqliteSaver` checkpoint resume/HIL tests, and retry-policy behavior. Next.js scope covers the `proxy.ts` convention, route matchers, auth/tenant redirects, and absence of stale `middleware` configuration.
- [ ] **INT-FOLLOWUP-07**: Frontend/security toolchain major audit stages `jose` 5-to-6, shadcn CLI 3-to-4, ESLint 9-to-10, and TypeScript 5-to-6 before bumping. The audit must verify Node/runtime compatibility, JWT sign/verify/cookie auth behavior, shadcn registry/dry-run behavior, lint config lookup and custom rule compatibility, TypeScript root/module defaults, `npm run lint`, typecheck, Next build, and representative auth/navigation Playwright smoke tests.
- [ ] **EVAL-FOLLOWUP-01**: Eval engine judge operations include provider-backed judge invocation, judge-model re-baselining, model/prompt/dataset version capture, and cost ownership before customer-facing eval claims are made.
- [ ] **EVAL-API-FOLLOWUP-01**: Public eval API v2 supports production ingestion and notification patterns: external OpenInference traces, OpenTelemetry collector bridge, bulk trace submission, webhook push delivery, and streaming/SSE result delivery.
- [ ] **EVAL-API-FOLLOWUP-02**: Public eval API operations are externalization-ready: Redis or shared rate limiting for multi-instance deployments, tenant API-key UI, usage metering/billing hooks, SDK semantic-version automation, and verified `docs/eval-quickstart.md` before customer exposure.
- [ ] **MEMGEN-FOLLOWUP-01**: Memory autogen proposals must have an explicit phase contract and live-backend validation path: non-fixture evals exercise mem0/graph/vector memory, record deterministic replay evidence, and distinguish modeled W-lift from real behavioral lift.
- [ ] **SEAL-FOLLOWUP-01**: SEAL proposal lifecycle operations include governed auto-apply mode, bulk review, expiry/garbage-collection policy, and tenant isolation for proposal queues.
- [ ] **SEAL-FOLLOWUP-02**: SEAL proposal types become plugin-capable with file-system snapshot/restore for `skill_addition` mutations and a safe runtime proposal-type registry.
- [x] **SKILLOPT-FOLLOWUP-01**: SkillOpt-style automatic skill improvement is evaluated as a governed optimizer spike, not a live self-mutating runtime path. Scope includes a `SkillOptAdapter` worker, `skill_revision`/`skill_version_patch` SEAL proposal type, train/validation/held-out split tracking, accepted/rejected edit evidence, W non-regression gates, operator approval, rollback handles, and safe export of approved skills to runtime projections. Source note: `.planning/notes/skillopt-skill-optimization-spike.md`. Superseded by SKILLFORGE-01..06.

### SkillForge — Governed Skill Optimization (v6.0)

Based on deep research of GBrain's skillify meta-skill, fail-improve loop, dream cycle, and eval architecture; Microsoft SkillOpt's textual learning rate and bounded edit loop; and Memroos's existing eval engine, SEAL governance, and skill registry.

- [ ] **SKILLFORGE-01**: SkillForge Foundation — `SkillForgeWorker` cron/event-driven worker that consumes skill telemetry from `skill_registry`, `eval_candidates`, and SEAL evidence bundles; outputs SEAL proposals of type `skill_revision`. Includes intake pipeline with privacy redaction gates, trace normalization, and skill-scope filtering. No direct mutation of active runtime skills.
- [ ] **SKILLFORGE-02**: SkillForge Analysis — Pattern detection engine that identifies skill failure modes (trigger mismatches, resolver routing errors, contract violations, tool misuse) from telemetry logs. Includes a deterministic-first `SkillFailImproveLoop` that logs routing failures, groups by pattern, generates test cases from LLM fallback successes, and proposes deterministic trigger/rule improvements before LLM reflection.
- [ ] **SKILLFORGE-03**: SkillForge Proposal Generation — Bounded SKILL.md edit generation with textual learning rate control. Proposes edits to: triggers (add/remove/refine), contract clauses, phase steps, anti-patterns, and tool declarations. Rejected-edit buffer prevents re-trying failed edits. Edit scope is constrained: cannot mutate security policy, governance policy, AGENTS.md directives, or owner-protection instructions.
- [ ] **SKILLFORGE-04**: SkillForge Evaluation — Train/validation/held-out split tracking for skill proposals. Training set: historical traces and existing golden sets. Validation: deterministic scorer (trigger routing accuracy, contract completeness, resolver reachability). Held-out: behavioral eval via sandboxed agent execution with no-op tool stubs on 10-20 task samples. W delta computed via existing `EvalService.rescoreForProposal()` with modeled + behavioral components.
- [ ] **SKILLFORGE-05**: SkillForge Governance — Operator-visible UI path showing: candidate diff, evidence bundle, W delta, held-out pass/fail, rejected-edit summary, residual risks, and promotion gate. SEAL proposal lifecycle: queued → analyzing → eval-running → gated → pending_approval → approved → applied → exported. Rollback handle preserved for every approved revision. Auto-apply disabled for all skill revisions; operator approval required.
- [ ] **SKILLFORGE-06**: SkillForge Integration — Cross-modal eval integration using Memroos eval engine (3-model, multi-provider scoring on 5 dimensions). Skill maintenance cycle ("SkillCycle") adapted from GBrain's dream cycle: lint → sync → analyze → propose → eval → gate → embed → orphans → purge. Export to Codex/Claude/OpenClaw runtime projections only after SEAL approval. Skill registry updated with revision history, eval receipts, and rollback pointers.
- [ ] **AGENTGEN-FOLLOWUP-01**: Agent trajectory evaluation adds a trace-capture to human-annotation workflow, configurable `max_trajectory_steps`, and audit events for eval preset changes so W trends remain interpretable.
- [ ] **L3-FOLLOWUP-01**: Business outcome layer adds live Salesforce, Zendesk, and NetSuite adapters with real OAuth/SOAP/API setup rather than fixtures.
- [ ] **L3-FOLLOWUP-02**: Business outcome ingestion supports inbound webhooks and automated correlation-ID injection or setup verification for external systems, not only polling/manual configuration.
- [ ] **L3-FOLLOWUP-03**: Business outcome scoring validates against production tenant data with per-company golden sets, W-threshold alerts, and configurable SLA/TTR targets instead of observed-only signals.
- [ ] **AUTH-FOLLOWUP-01**: Team auth hardening adds email invitation delivery, password reset, email change/verification, OAuth/SSO login, and login/refresh lockout telemetry.
- [ ] **AUTH-FOLLOWUP-02**: Role-aware UI gating hides or disables unauthorized nav/actions before click-through while keeping API/page-level 403 enforcement.
- [ ] **AUTH-FOLLOWUP-03**: Tenant/admin management includes API-key rotation, tenant settings, user lifecycle management, and migration of legacy audit actor fields to authenticated user identity.
- [ ] **AUDIT-FOLLOWUP-01**: Audit compliance hardening adds tamper-evident hash chaining plus retention and archival policies configurable by admins.
- [ ] **AUDIT-FOLLOWUP-02**: HIL/escalation operations add email/webhook or Slack notifications, bulk resolution, and SLA escalation UX beyond the queue-only view.
- [ ] **AUDIT-FOLLOWUP-03**: Audit access expands to full-text search over reason/metadata and tenant-scoped audit-log access through the public/customer API boundary.
- [ ] **UX-FOLLOWUP-01**: ClaudeClaw-inspired Chat tab provides a dedicated command/chat workspace for CLIs, Paperclip project agents, runtime subagents, and MemroOS system identities separate from Flow.
- [ ] **UX-FOLLOWUP-02**: Memory search surface unifies SQLite recall, mem0/vector memory, Neo4j graph memory, qmd/knowledge files, and filters for agent, project, source, date, and memory tier.
- [ ] **UX-FOLLOWUP-03**: Schedules and routines console exposes recurring jobs, cron health, standing delegations, maintenance routines, and approval-required automations.
- [ ] **UX-FOLLOWUP-04**: Hivemind Obsidian view provides graph/canvas exploration of agents, memories, tasks, proposals, skills, backlinks, and relationships.
- [ ] **UX-FOLLOWUP-05**: Paperclip design-system completion migrates drawers, sheets, modals, detail panels, empty states, and error states off the older dark dashboard shell.
- [ ] **UX-FOLLOWUP-06**: Flow canvas redesign migrates React Flow topology, minimap, controls, node cards, edge styling, group boxes, and node detail panels into the Paperclip-style system while preserving graph readability.
- [ ] **GSD-FOLLOWUP-01**: Milestone close requires every phase-local deferred item, open context question, scope trim, and retro-documented gap to be either closed as intentionally shipped, promoted to a requirement ID, or marked explicitly out of scope with rationale.
- [x] **UI-PARITY-01**: Correct phase and requirement status claims so `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, plan summaries, and actual operator-visible behavior agree (Phase 73 completed; v4.0 now closes through Phase 73 with NOC live-data debt still tracked as NOC-01..11).
- [x] **UI-PARITY-02**: Wire the Phase 70 HIL edit-and-continue UI into the live orchestration approval panel so an operator can edit, validate, audit, and resume a real paused HIL task from the visible app surface (Phase 73 mounts `HilEditPanel` in `OrchestrationHilPanel`).
- [x] **UI-PARITY-03**: Complete Phase 71 wave-2 operator surfaces and contracts: semantic/hybrid recall endpoint plus embedding job, HIL SLA countdown/traffic-light dashboard, and recording-consent gate plus meeting join UI.
- [x] **UI-PARITY-04**: Reconcile the Operations NOC with product truth: replace mock panels with live data where available, or clearly render missing/degraded telemetry states until the NOC real-data requirements are implemented (Phase 73 changes NOC header to telemetry-preview/live-wiring-pending and efficiency signals to a missing-telemetry checklist).
- [x] **UI-PARITY-05**: Add a GSD phase-close gate requiring every completed phase to declare its operator representation: visible UI, visible status/provenance in an existing UI, API/backend-only with explicit label, or promoted follow-up UI requirement (Phase 73 adds `validatePhaseUiRepresentation()` and updates `.planning/GOAL.md`).
- [ ] Recall.ai bridge for Zoom/Teams/Meet meeting bot (Daily-only in v4.0)
- [ ] Full 50+ task behavioral W-lift golden set (held-out sample in v4.0)
- [ ] Voyage AI `voyage-4-large` embedding upgrade (Ollama local in v4.0, env-flag swap)
- [ ] Multi-participant meeting bot (listener-only in v4.0)
- [ ] Cross-harness skill auto-sync from agent directories (manual import in v4.0)
- [ ] Full Harness Control Plane: every dispatched task exposes a Plan-Execute-Verify timeline with plan contract, permission tier, tool actions, verification checks, and memory updates (Phase 72 covers the first evidence-bundle slice for eval/skill work)
- [ ] Universal evidence bundles: every agent output can show sources used, memories consumed, tools/commands run, checks passed, unverified assumptions, residual risks, and replay/rollback artifacts (Phase 72 covers SEAL/UI/skill evidence first)
- [ ] Shared harness state: tasks declare read/write sets, assumptions, version dependencies, verifier obligations, and conflict policy; stale belief/context drift is surfaced before action
- [ ] Skill-contract evidence examples: promoted skills attach worked examples and regression cases to the governed contract fields introduced in Phase 72
- [ ] Evolution Agent: telemetry-driven harness improvements are proposed, evaluated against held-out regression tasks, and require approval before changing permissions, validators, routing, or workflow topology
- [ ] Knowledge graph intelligence: repo/docs/PDF/image/transcript graphs expose confidence-tagged edges, god nodes, surprising connections, query/path/explain flows, wiki/report exports, and freshness hooks
- [ ] PR/workflow graph risk: graph communities and dependency paths identify merge-order conflicts, impacted concepts, stale graph regions, and coordination risk before dispatch or review
- [ ] Stacked agent work units: large agent tasks can be split into ordered, dependent, independently reviewable slices with stack-aware verification, promotion gates, and rollback invalidation when an earlier slice fails
- [ ] Model gateway observability: LiteLLM can be configured as the first optional `ModelGatewayAdapter` while direct-provider fallback remains available; every LLM call records provider/model route, prompt/template version, cache hit/miss, fallback path, token/cost budget, latency, and denial reason in the task evidence bundle
- [ ] Secret-scope health: runtime health checks flag agent secrets that are not project scoped, not loaded from an approved secret manager path, or risk persistence in plain `.env`/audit artifacts
- [ ] Eval-pinned promotion commits: passing eval runs capture model version, prompt/harness version, pass rate, dataset seed, and commit/release pointer for incident rollback
- [ ] Agent lessons ledger: repo-level lessons are captured from weird behavior, edge cases, config changes, incidents, and promoted skills, then surfaced in context packs and graph freshness checks
- [ ] Third-party eval adapter: Inspect-style safety eval packs can plug into the existing eval engine for deception, tool misuse, manipulation, and policy-boundary checks

## Out of Scope

- Zoom/Teams native transport without bridge (platform anti-bot measures; Daily.co is the supported path)
- Recursive readdir for cross-project recall (performance constraint; explicit path config only)
- Redis/Celery/Temporal for retry/rollback (stdlib + LangGraph `RetryPolicy` sufficient)
- node-llama-cpp local inference (macOS arm64 crash bug, GitHub upstream unfixed)

## v4.1 / Backlog Requirements

### Cron Job Health Monitoring (new)

- [ ] **CRON-HEALTH-01**: Recurring cron jobs ("sinks") that perform data ingestion, memory writes, or external API polling must expose a health status endpoint or heartbeat that the MemroOS dashboard can consume.
- [ ] **CRON-HEALTH-02**: The schedules and routines console (UX-FOLLOWUP-03) must surface per-job last-run timestamp, success/failure status, items processed, and any warnings or caught-up/caught-up status.
- [ ] **CRON-HEALTH-03**: Jobs that are not caught up (e.g., Spark transcript ingestion lagging behind real-time) must emit a warning-level health signal that appears in the NOC and/or operator notification surface.
- [ ] **CRON-HEALTH-04**: Operators must be able to pause, resume, or stop individual cron jobs from the dashboard without restarting the entire MemroOS runtime.
- [ ] **CRON-HEALTH-05**: Job definitions must be declarative (e.g., stored in a config or registry) so that the health monitoring surface knows what jobs *should* exist and can detect missing or orphaned schedules.
