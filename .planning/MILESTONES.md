# Milestones

## v2.5 Eval Engine + Self-Improvement Platform (Shipped: 2026-05-17)

**Phases completed:** 6 phases, 7 plans, 0 tasks

**Key accomplishments:**

- 3-layer composite eval signal (`W`) with scorer registry, pinned judge, drift guard, persistence, and UI/config surface.
- SEAL reflection/proposal/apply/rollback loop with deterministic modeled post-apply re-scoring and explicit audit metadata.
- Memory and agent autogen proposal families registered on the shared SEAL substrate, with fixed-harness policy labs and trajectory scoring.
- Minimal viable golden sets populated and verified against the real judge, making the drift guard meaningful at the Tier 1 bar.
- L3 business outcome layer, public eval API, and TypeScript/Python SDKs established as the external product surface.
- Behavioral W-lift for instruction/skill proposals intentionally deferred to v3 rather than overclaimed.

**Known deferred items at close:** 2 context-question buckets acknowledged in `STATE.md`.

## v1.7 Progressive Tool Gateway Runtime (In Progress)

**Phases:** 29-32 | **Plans:** 2/5 complete

**Completed so far:**

1. **Top-Level Tool Gateway MCP Tools (Phase 29)** — Knowledge MCP now exposes direct `tool_catalog`, `tool_discover`, `tool_load`, `tool_record_outcome`, and `tool_stats` tools, while preserving the v1.6 workspace gateway.
2. **Outcome-Aware Tool Selection (Phase 30 Plan 01)** — Tool Attention summarizes recent outcomes by capability and uses outcome scores to influence discovery ranking without returning private task text.

**Remaining:**

1. **Memory-Aware Tool Selection (Phase 30 Plan 02)** — Add similar-task memory signals on top of outcome ranking.
2. **Kitchen Tool Gateway Operations UI (Phase 31)** — Turn the UI from catalog visibility into an operations console.
3. **Gateway Hardening and Lint Cleanup (Phase 32)** — Make full lint enforceable and add CI coverage for the top-level gateway tools.

## v1.6 Monorepo + Progressive MCP Tool Attention (Shipped: 2026-04-30)

**Phases:** 26–28 | **Plans:** 3 | **3/3 phases complete**

**Key accomplishments:**

1. **Monorepo Foundation (Phase 26)** — Kitchen moved to `apps/kitchen`, services moved/imported under `services/`, root scripts delegate to the app, and root-aware runtime paths preserve SQLite/config behavior.
2. **Progressive MCP Tool Attention (Phase 27)** — Knowledge MCP imported with progressive workspaces, tool-attention workspace actions, curated catalog, outcome logging, Kitchen API, Cookbooks panel, and Flow Tool Gateway node.
3. **CI + Deploy Hardening (Phase 28)** — Production build and LaunchAgent deployment verified, live health/tool-attention endpoints checked, and monorepo CI added for Kitchen and Python service validation.

**Requirements satisfied:** 16/16 (all checkboxes marked [x])
**Verification:** Kitchen tests, Knowledge MCP tests, Python compile smoke, shell syntax checks, production build, and live endpoint checks all passed.
