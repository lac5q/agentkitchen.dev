# Phase 44 Summary: Security Operations UI + Reports

Completed 2026-05-11.

## Product Goal

Let an operator see what security controls are active, what was blocked, which actors were involved, and whether any security events require attention.

## Shipped

- Added `/api/security/report`.
- Added `SecurityOperationsPanel`.
- Mounted the panel in Library under Memory Governance.
- Added redacted security event timeline, posture status, blocked attempt counts, severity counts, control status, and top actors.

## Verification

- `npm --prefix apps/memroos run test -- src/app/api/security/report/__tests__/route.test.ts` passed.
- Full `npm test -- --run` passed.
- Playwright browser check confirmed `/library` renders `Security Operations`.

## Risk Notes

Security report details are redacted before they reach the UI. Raw bearer tokens, `sk-*`, `ak_*`, and common token/secret fields are masked.
