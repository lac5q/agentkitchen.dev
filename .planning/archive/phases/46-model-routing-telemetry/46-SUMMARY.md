# Phase 46 Summary: Model Routing Telemetry Substrate

Completed 2026-05-11.

## Product Goal

Turn model choice into retained evidence by capturing structured outcomes for product, sales, engineering, and support workflows.

## Shipped

- Added `apps/memroos/src/lib/model-routing.ts`.
- Added route-local `model_routing_events` table initialization.
- Added `/api/model-routing/telemetry` GET and POST.
- Captured task type, agent, provider, model, strategy, latency, token counts, cost estimate, success, quality score, tags, prompt hash, and error.

## Verification

- Model routing route tests passed.
- Full `npm test -- --run` passed.
- `npm run typecheck` passed.

## Risk Notes

Raw prompt text is never stored or returned. Optional prompt input is hashed with SHA-256.
