## Executive Summary

Memroos v5.0 is a security and observability hardening milestone for a production A2A agent hub. The system already has RBAC (v3.0), an 18-pattern content scanner (v1.5), HIL orchestration (v4.0), and a three-tier memory architecture (SQLite + Qdrant + Neo4j). The research consensus is that v5.0 must close three critical gaps before expanding agent autonomy: (1) sensitive organizational memory (legal, finance, HR, credentials) has no ingestion classification gate and no retrieval authorization boundary; (2) the NOC operations console is wired to mock data in production, eroding operator trust; and (3) the auth layer is missing email delivery, password reset, and OAuth/SSO — the table-stakes floor for any multi-user or team deployment.

The recommended approach is a strict build order enforced by hard dependencies: the security label schema must be designed and migrated first because every subsequent component — the retrieval gate, safe indexes, envelope encryption, evidence bundle provenance, and security regression tests — reads from it. The classification cascade uses a deterministic-first design (existing 18-pattern scanner + new NER/metadata detectors + Presidio Python service) before invoking the LLM adjudicator only on low-confidence cases. All encryption uses Node.js and Python standard-library primitives — no new crypto npm packages. Auth hardening is fully parallelizable with the security chain.

The top risks: (1) Backfill blindness — existing FTS5/Qdrant/Neo4j content bypasses the new retrieval gate unless a reclassification sweep completes and MEMSEC-08 negative tests pass before the gate is declared live. (2) Embedding before classification — the 5-minute background embedding job will vector-index restricted content unless a provisional `private` label blocks the embedding path at write time. (3) The mem0 HTTP write path is ungoverned by the TypeScript ingestion layer, requiring retrieve-time classification as a compensating control.

## Stack Additions (Net-New Only)

No new database, no new scheduler, no Redis, no Socket.io.

**New npm dependencies:**

## Feature Table Stakes

**Must ship:**

- Fail-closed ingestion classification: private-by-default, deterministic-first cascade, human review queue with SLA + drain path
- Retrieval authorization gate on every recall, memory search, context pack, ChatGPT Action, export, and A2A dispatch path
- Envelope encryption for raw vault artifacts (AES-GCM + AES-KW, key rotation, retired-key retention for replay)
- MEMSEC-08 negative tests proving restricted fixtures cannot surface through any retrieval path
- Classification-aware safe indexes — restricted content excluded from FTS5, Qdrant, Neo4j, qmd
- All 14 NOC panels backed by live data with per-panel `{source, lastUpdated, window, status}` provenance; no mock-data imports in production
- Cron job heartbeat + caught-up monitoring with pause/resume controls and declarative job registry
- Password reset via email + email invitations + OAuth/SSO (Google, GitHub)

**Should ship (differentiators):**

- Two-gateway model: ingestion classification AND retrieval authorization
- Redacted projections with vault provenance — not binary allow/deny
- Efficiency telemetry signals (retrieval-without-action, source re-read, operator re-ask redundancy, rediscovered-fact rate)
- Universal evidence bundles on all A2A tasks (Plan-Execute-Verify timeline, sources, memories, tools, replay handle)
- Schedules Console showing all recurring jobs with health and controls

**Defer to v5.1+:**

- Memory search surface (UX-FOLLOWUP-02) — wait for retrieval gate to stabilize
- TOTP/FIDO2 MFA — SSO covers immediate auth risk floor
- Cloud KMS adapter (AWS, GCP) — LocalFileKeyProvider sufficient
- Enterprise SAML/WorkOS

## Architecture Decisions

**Retrieval authorization gate:** Single `lib/memory/policy-gate.ts` library intercepting at route boundary above all MemoryAdapters. Adapters remain actor-unaware. Every gate decision logged to `audit_log`.

**Raw vault:** Filesystem directory (`~/.memroos/vault/<tenant>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/`) with SQLite metadata index only — no blobs in SQLite. Label schema on both `raw_artifacts` and `messages` via additive ALTER TABLE with safe defaults.

**Classification cascade:** Composes with existing `content-scanner.ts` as the first sub-stage → Presidio NER (Python FastAPI endpoint) → constrained LLM adjudicator only on low-confidence cases.

**OAuth/SSO:** Acquisition-path shim terminating at existing `signAccessToken()`. JWT format, session cookies, RBAC roles unchanged. Email-as-merge-key binds OAuth provider to existing user.

**Universal evidence bundles:** New `task_evidence_bundles` table keyed on `a2a_tasks.task_id`. SEAL-specific bundles remain a sibling.

**New SQLite tables:** `raw_artifacts`, `artifact_labels`, `classification_reviews`, `task_evidence_bundles`, `efficiency_events`, `cron_job_registry`, `password_reset_tokens`.

**Modified tables:** `messages`, `audit_log`, `hive_actions`, `agent_memory_writes`, `recall_log` gain label columns via additive migrations.

## Critical Build Order

```
Phase 74: Security Label Schema + Raw Vault       MEMSEC-01, MEMSEC-02
  └─ Phase 75: Classification Cascade             MEMSEC-03, CTX-FOLLOWUP-03
  └─ Phase 76: Retrieval Authorization Gate       MEMSEC-04
       └─ Phase 77: Safe Indexes + Encryption     MEMSEC-05..07
            └─ Phase 78: Security Regression      MEMSEC-08

Phase 79: NOC Telemetry + Real-Data              NOC-01..14, OPS-AUDIT-01..04    (parallel)
Phase 80: Cron Health + Schedules Console        CTX-FOLLOWUP-01..02, CRON-HEALTH-01..05, UX-FOLLOWUP-03  (parallel)
Phase 81: Evidence Bundles + Harness Control     Harness reqs  (soft depends Phase 74)
Phase 82: Auth Hardening                         AUTH-FOLLOWUP-01..03  (fully parallel)
```

**Critical path:** 74 → 75 → 76 → 77 → 78. All other phases are parallel.

## Watch Out For

1. **Backfill blindness (highest severity):** Existing FTS5/Qdrant/Neo4j content bypasses the new gate. Prevention: full reclassification sweep before gate enforces; MEMSEC-08 tests as enforcement gate.

2. **Embedding before classification:** Background embedding job will vector-index restricted content if no provisional label blocks it. Prevention: stamp `private` at write time; add label check in embedding job to skip `policy=sealed`.

3. **mem0 HTTP bypass:** Agent writes via mem0 HTTP API skip the TypeScript ingestion gate. Prevention: classify at retrieval for `agent_memory` content; document and test the gap.

4. **Detector sprawl:** Old scanner and new detectors creating coverage gaps. Prevention: old scanner is the first sub-stage of a unified `DetectorPipeline`.

5. **OAuth middleware wrapping machine-facing routes:** A2A API key auth, MCP gateway, Python proxy break silently with global OAuth middleware. Prevention: composable `withOAuth` vs. `withApiKey` middleware chains.

## Research Flags

**Needs planning spike before phase starts:**

- **Phase 75:** Presidio `en_core_web_lg` model startup latency. If > 2s, async classification strategy becomes mandatory. 30-minute timing spike resolves.
- **Phase 81:** Shared harness state conflict detection semantics. Novel architecture. Brief design spec before coding.

**Standard patterns (no research needed):** Phases 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82.

---

## Open Questions

- **KEK provider default** — LocalFileKeyProvider at `~/.memroos/vault.key` (follows `MEMROOS_SCHEDULER_LOCK` convention)
- **mem0 HTTP bypass scope** — audit all A2A task types for direct mem0 writes before Phase 76 gate goes live
- **Classification review queue SLA values** — suggested: meeting transcripts 48h, credentials 4h; not finalized
- **Evidence bundle scope** — define whether external A2A tasks, Paperclip fleet tasks, and voice sessions are included in Phase 81
