# State: Memroos

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04 for v2.0)

**Core value:** Any agent framework plugs into Memroos — and every agent, knowledge system, and skill becomes visible, connected, and self-improving.
**Current focus:** v5.2 competitive memory target architecture is complete; next focus is deploy/communication and 30-day skill auto-promotion audit

## Current Position

Phase: 97 — Source Routing Contracts for Meeting Capture
Plan: 97-01
Status: Complete — MemRoOS knowledge indexing now fails on Cordant-looking meetings filed under the wrong project and verifies Cordant qmd freshness.
Last activity: 2026-05-28 -- Phase 97 shipped with deterministic route contracts, regression tests, qmd refresh, and corrected May 27 Cordant corpus state.
Next action: extend `DEFAULT_MEETING_ROUTE_CONTRACTS` as additional high-value project routing anchors emerge.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-05-28T07:31:59.056Z
Stopped at: Phase 97 complete after Cordant meeting routing incident
Resume file: None
Next action: extend route contracts for more project anchors as needed

**Critical path:** 74 → 75 → 76 → 77 → 78. Phases 79, 80, 81, 82 run parallel (81 soft-depends on 74).
**Completed so far:** Phase 34 through Phase 97 shipped.

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total v2.0-v2.4 plans completed: 29
- Phase 35 execution completed: 2026-05-05
- Phase 36 completed: 2026-05-05
- Latest Phase 40 gate: docs link/content review, markdown grep checks, Memroos lint, and build passed

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution (2026-05-27)

- Phase 97 added after the May 27 Cordant/Juan Spark meeting was captured in raw/global knowledge but misfiled under `projects/general`; permanent work tracks source-routing contracts, route confidence/review state, project qmd freshness proof, and operator visibility across raw capture, project promotion, qmd indexing, and app-level memory promotion.
- Phase 97 completed with deterministic Cordant route signals in `scripts/check-knowledge-indexing.mjs`, regression tests, and qmd proof that the May 27 meeting now lives under `projects/cordant` and the `cordant` collection.

### Positioning Guardrails (2026-05-21)

- Lead public positioning with shared organizational memory, governed orchestration, evidence/provenance, and interop across agent frameworks.
- Treat voice as an ingestion surface for memory, not a standalone product pillar.
- Frame `qmd update` UI work as context freshness and source evidence, not as a search-admin feature.
- Phase 72 should make evidence bundles and governed skill contracts explicit in acceptance criteria because they explain what memory was consumed, what tools ran, which checks passed, and what can be replayed or rolled back.

### Decisions (Phase 72 Plan 06)

- **Skill dispatch lookup key is skill_name:** Optional string in dispatch request body — no new mapping table needed; dispatchers pass skill_name when they want governed execution
- **SQL WHERE enforces enabled+complete at DB layer:** fail-closed is not a JS post-filter; `dispatch_status='enabled' AND completeness_pct=100` is in the SQL query so no future code path can bypass it
- **Evidence never includes untrusted body text:** SkillContractSummary exposes only id/name/source_harness/risk_tier/dispatch_status/completeness_pct — raw_body, preconditions, allowed_tools, verification_checks excluded from all evidence paths
- **Fallback path preserved:** no skill_name → null result → existing adapter dispatch proceeds unchanged; no governance overhead on non-governed tasks

### Decisions (Phase 72 Plan 05)

- **Dispatch fail-closed:** completeness < 100% OR missing REQUIRED_CONTRACT_FIELDS → dispatch_status='incomplete'; only fully-complete skill with explicit frontmatter 'enabled' gets dispatch_status='enabled'
- **Prompt injection as data:** parseSkillMd() stores raw_body and all fields verbatim; no eval, no exec; sanitization is caller responsibility; audit trail preserved
- **UNIQUE(name, source_harness) with ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE:** idempotent re-import replaces previous entry
- **Pagination indexes on skill_registry:** (source_harness, dispatch_status) and (dispatch_status, imported_at DESC) per performance note
- **GET /api/skills/import is read-only (no operator auth):** Browser UI needs unauthenticated read access to show registry skills; POST import remains operator-gated

### Decisions (Phase 72 Plan 02)

- **ApplyResult discriminated union:** `kind='sync'` for legacy proposal types; `kind='job'` for behavioral types — callers must switch on `result.kind` before accessing type-specific fields
- **Behavioral proposal predicate:** `agent_instruction_patch` and `skill_addition` are the two types requiring async eval (D-06); all other types keep the synchronous apply path
- **seal_eval_jobs + seal_evidence_bundles:** additive tables with FK to `seal_proposals (ON DELETE CASCADE)`; sandbox profile fails closed — all tool calls denied by default, all calls recorded in evidence bundle

### Decisions (Phase 70 Plan 04)

- **MemoryAdapter interface:** `capabilities` field is required (not optional) — MemoryCapability union = semantic|graphTraversal|reasoningTrace|bufferedWrite|tenantScoped|auditEdges
- **Registry pattern:** `Map<MemoryTier, MemoryAdapter[]>` with registerAdapter/getAdapters/clearRegistry; module-init idempotency via `_registered` guard
- **Shim delegation:** existing exported functions check `getAdapters(tier)[0]` first, fallback to direct impl — exactly one path per tier, no double-writer (T-70-12)
- **EpisodicMemoryAdapter.write() is a no-op stub** — episodic writes must go through the full db-ingest pipeline for FTS5 index integrity

### Decisions (carried into v2.0)

- Production runs on port 3002 via `npm start -- --port 3002`; kill existing: `lsof -ti :3002 | xargs kill -9`
- After any build change: rebuild with `npm run build` then restart
- **Vector store architecture (CRITICAL):** QMD handles BM25/lexical only. ALL vector/semantic search uses Qdrant Cloud. `qmd embed` is FORBIDDEN.
- **Security:** No `execSync`/`exec` — use `execFileSync` or pure `fs/promises` only
- **mem0 writes:** Only via `POST http://localhost:3201/memory/add` — never touch `agent_memory` Qdrant directly
- **Group children:** Use `parentId` + `extent:'parent'` pattern (Phase 17 — already in codebase)
- **Qdrant stays cloud:** Never add local Qdrant to Docker compose — configured via QDRANT_URL + QDRANT_API_KEY env vars
- **Docker compose is for OSS users only:** Luis keeps native workflow (npm start, LaunchAgent, port 3002)
- **Memory stack is fixed for v2.0:** mem0 + Qdrant Cloud (vector) + Neo4j (graph, new) + SQLite (episodic). No pluggability until v3.0.

### v2.0 architectural constraints

- **LangGraph runs as a Python service** — separate process from Next.js, same pattern as Pipecat voice service
- **LangGraph checkpoint DB is `data/orchestration.db`** — SEPARATE from Memroos's main SQLite DB to avoid cross-process lock contention
- **A2A adapter and LangGraph are separate layers** — A2A owns transport/protocol/task-state mapping; LangGraph owns routing policy, capability selection, retry, HIL. They communicate via internal API (ORCH-07 contract)
- **REG-00 canonical registry is complete** — A2A and REST registration both write through the same model
- **Phase 35 A2A layer is complete** — agent cards, A2A registration, durable task APIs, SSE, outbound delegation, ADK fixture, Registry/Flow surfacing
- **A2A adapter routing is protocol-driven** — `protocol: a2a` selects A2A; platform alone does not reroute legacy Gemini agents
- **Outbound A2A credentials are env-key-only** — metadata may name an env var, but UI must not render bearer/API-key values or raw auth headers
- **ADK proof fixture is optional** — `examples/adk-a2a-agent/` is not imported by Memroos startup

### v2.5 ACTUAL Status (reconciliation audit 2026-05-16)

Prior STATE.md claimed "all 6 phases shipped" — that was FALSE. No SUMMARY.md
exists for any phase; all work is uncommitted; production build is broken.
Verdict: coherent partial work (real logic, not scaffolding), NOT shippable.

| Phase | Name | Actual Status |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 57 | Eval Engine Core | PARTIAL — engine/scorers/judge real; golden set ~3/50 rows |
| 58 | SEAL Self-Improvement | PARTIAL — full loop coded; 4 real test failures (audit FK, eval lookups) |
| 59 | Memory Autogen | UNPLANNED — code exists, NO phase dir/plan/contract |
| 60 | Agent Autogen | PARTIAL/MISSING — golden sets 2/50 each; no dogfood W-lift evidence |
| 61 | Business-Ops L3 | PARTIAL — schema/code column mismatch will break L3 at runtime |
| 62 | Public Eval API + SDK | PARTIAL — SDKs real, route paths diverge from plan |

Scope creep outside v2.5: phases 63 (Rename+Team Auth) & 64 (Immutable Audit+HIL)
have plan dirs + code (lib/auth/, /api/auth/, login/register) — v3 direction.
| Phase 70-foundation-engine-core P05 | 11 minutes | 3 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 70-foundation-engine-core P03 | 35m | 3 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 71-recall-hil-sla-voice P03 | 8 | 3 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 72-cross-project-recall-behavioral-w-lift-ui-skills P01 | 6m | 3 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 72 P02 | 15m | 3 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 72 P04 | 40m | 3 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 72 P05 | 36m | 3 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 72 P06 | 12m | 3 tasks | 4 files |

### Blockers/Concerns (verified)

- **BUILD BROKEN:** new untracked `apps/memroos/src/middleware.ts` (auth, ph63/64)
  collides with `proxy.ts`. This Next.js replaced middleware→proxy; the two files
  hold *different* logic (RBAC vs host-redirect) and must be merged, not deleted.

- **91/545 tests fail** (25 files): SEAL audit-log FK bug, L3 schema mismatch,
  plus mock-setup failures (hive lineage, memory tier routes).

- Golden sets ~4% populated — drift guard / agreement criteria cannot be validated.
- `bcryptjs` declared in package.json but may need `npm install`.
- `.codex/` & `.agents/` untracked tool state — should be gitignored, NOT committed.
- GitNexus embeddings partial (285/473) — upstream crash bug (abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#824)

### v2.5 Finishing Pass (2026-05-16) — what closed

- ✅ **Golden sets populated** (minimal viable): 57 business-ops 16 rows, 60
  sales/support/finance/ops 15 each. Verified vs real judge — drift agreement
  ≥0.85 with positive + policy-leak negative classes. Reproducible via
  `golden-sets/.generate.mjs`. Full ~50-row sets still a future nice-to-have.

- ✅ **Path/naming ratified** as-built for 61 (`lib/l3`) and 62
  (`/api/public/v1/*`) via plan amendments — rename deferred to external
  packaging. No longer open.

- ✅ **Phase 59 retro-documented** — PLAN + PARTIAL SUMMARY authored; all 6
  MEMGEN reqs implemented + tested.

### v2.5 Tier 1 closure (2026-05-16)

- ✅ **Dogfood W-lift closed at Tier 1:** `EvalService.rescoreForProposal`
  now uses `lib/seal/rescore.ts` to run deterministic modeled post-apply
  re-scoring through the real eval engine, golden-set loader, layer scorers,
  judge, drift guard, persistence, and SEAL audit metadata. Keep and rollback
  are both reachable without a mocked eval service.

- ✅ **Honesty guardrail preserved:** memory/config proposal classes can move W
  via the modeled fixed-harness delta. `agent_instruction_patch`,
  ## Current Position

  Phase: 96 — Agent Memory Continuity
  Plan: 96-01
  Status: Complete — MemRoOS-native coding-agent capture and handoff packs implemented.
  Last activity: 2026-05-27 -- AGENTMEM-FOLLOWUP-01 shipped with schema, APIs, tests, and typecheck.
  Next action: deploy/restart MemRoOS and optional UI polish for capture health

  ## Session Continuity

  Last session: 2026-05-27T07:20:00.000Z
  Stopped at: Phase 96 complete, Agent Memory Continuity shipped
  Resume file: None
  Next action: deploy/restart MemRoOS and optional UI polish for capture health

## UAT Findings (2026-05-17)

- **Root cause fixed:** `apps/memroos/.env.local` was missing `MEMROOS_JWT_SECRET`, `MEMROOS_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `MEMROOS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. These live in root `.env` which Next.js doesn't load. Added to `.env.local` (gitignored).
- **Tenant API key mismatch:** `tak-default-internal` hash was stale. Updated to match current `MEMROOS_OPERATOR_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.
- **All 18 pages 200 OK**, 680 tests passing, eval engine E2E verified (W=0.7035), public API functional.
