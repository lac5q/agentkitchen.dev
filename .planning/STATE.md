# State: Memroos

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04 for v2.0)

**Core value:** Any agent framework plugs into Memroos — and every agent, knowledge system, and skill becomes visible, connected, and self-improving.
**Current focus:** Phase 74 — security-label-schema-raw-vault

## Current Position

Phase: 74 — Security Label Schema + Raw Vault (not started; awaiting plan-phase)
Plan: —
Status: Roadmap approved; planning Phase 74
Last activity: 2026-05-24 — v5.0 roadmap created (phases 74-82, 41 requirements)

## Roadmap Summary (v5.0)

| 74 | Security Label Schema + Raw Vault — append-only vault, multi-dim labels, additive migrations with safe defaults | MEMSEC-01, MEMSEC-02 (2) |
| 75 | Classification Cascade + Ingestion Gate — fail-closed deterministic-first cascade + human review queue | MEMSEC-03, CTX-FOLLOWUP-03 (2) |
| 76 | Retrieval Authorization Gate — policy decision on every recall/export/dispatch path | MEMSEC-04 (1) |
| 77 | Safe Index Projections + Envelope Encryption — classification-aware FTS/vector/graph + AES-GCM rotation | MEMSEC-05, MEMSEC-06, MEMSEC-07 (3) |
| 78 | Security Regression Tests — negative-fixture suite proves no leak path | MEMSEC-08 (1) |
| 79 | NOC Telemetry + Real-Data Wiring — live NOC + provenance + efficiency telemetry | NOC-01..14, OPS-AUDIT-01..04 (18) |
| 80 | Cron Health Registry + Schedules Console — heartbeat, caught-up, pause/resume, source contracts | CTX-FOLLOWUP-01..02, CRON-HEALTH-01..05, UX-FOLLOWUP-03 (8) |
| 81 | Universal Evidence Bundles + Harness Control Plane — Plan-Execute-Verify timelines, shared state | HARN-01..03 (3) |

**Coverage:** 41/41 v5.0 requirements mapped, no orphans.
**Critical path:** 74 → 75 → 76 → 77 → 78. Phases 79, 80, 81, 82 run parallel (81 soft-depends on 74).
**Completed so far:** Phase 34 through Phase 73 (v2.0–v4.0 shipped).

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total v2.0-v2.4 plans completed: 29

- Phase 36 completed: 2026-05-05
- Latest Phase 40 gate: docs link/content review, markdown grep checks, Memroos lint, and build passed

## Accumulated Context

### Positioning Guardrails (2026-05-21)

- Lead public positioning with shared organizational memory, governed orchestration, evidence/provenance, and interop across agent frameworks.
- Treat voice as an ingestion surface for memory, not a standalone product pillar.
- Frame `qmd update` UI work as context freshness and source evidence, not as a search-admin feature.
- Phase 72 should make evidence bundles and governed skill contracts explicit in acceptance criteria because they explain what memory was consumed, what tools ran, which checks passed, and what can be replayed or rolled back.

### Decisions (Phase 72 Plan 06)

- **Skill dispatch lookup key is skill_name:** Optional string in dispatch request body — no new mapping table needed; dispatchers pass skill_name when they want governed execution
- **SQL WHERE enforces enabled+complete at DB layer:** fail-closed is not a JS post-filter; `dispatch_status='enabled' AND completeness_pct=100` is in the SQL query so no future code path can bypass it
- **Evidence never includes untrusted body text:** SkillContractSummary exposes only id/name/source_harness/risk_tier/dispatch_status/completeness_pct — raw_body, preconditions, allowed_tools, verification_checks excluded from all evidence paths
- **Fallback path preserved:** no skill_name → null result → existing adapter dispatch proceeds unchanged; no governance overhead on non-governed tasks

### Decisions (Phase 72 Plan 05)

- **Dispatch fail-closed:** completeness < 100% OR missing REQUIRED_CONTRACT_FIELDS → dispatch_status='incomplete'; only fully-complete skill with explicit frontmatter 'enabled' gets dispatch_status='enabled'
- **Prompt injection as data:** parseSkillMd() stores raw_body and all fields verbatim; no eval, no exec; sanitization is caller responsibility; audit trail preserved
- **UNIQUE(name, source_harness) with ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE:** idempotent re-import replaces previous entry
- **Pagination indexes on skill_registry:** (source_harness, dispatch_status) and (dispatch_status, imported_at DESC) per performance note
- **GET /api/skills/import is read-only (no operator auth):** Browser UI needs unauthenticated read access to show registry skills; POST import remains operator-gated

### Decisions (Phase 72 Plan 02)

- **ApplyResult discriminated union:** `kind='sync'` for legacy proposal types; `kind='job'` for behavioral types — callers must switch on `result.kind` before accessing type-specific fields
- **Behavioral proposal predicate:** `agent_instruction_patch` and `skill_addition` are the two types requiring async eval (D-06); all other types keep the synchronous apply path
- **seal_eval_jobs + seal_evidence_bundles:** additive tables with FK to `seal_proposals (ON DELETE CASCADE)`; sandbox profile fails closed — all tool calls denied by default, all calls recorded in evidence bundle

### Decisions (Phase 70 Plan 04)

- **MemoryAdapter interface:** `capabilities` field is required (not optional) — MemoryCapability union = semantic|graphTraversal|reasoningTrace|bufferedWrite|tenantScoped|auditEdges
- **Registry pattern:** `Map<MemoryTier, MemoryAdapter[]>` with registerAdapter/getAdapters/clearRegistry; module-init idempotency via `_registered` guard
- **Shim delegation:** existing exported functions check `getAdapters(tier)[0]` first, fallback to direct impl — exactly one path per tier, no double-writer (T-70-12)
- **EpisodicMemoryAdapter.write() is a no-op stub** — episodic writes must go through the full db-ingest pipeline for FTS5 index integrity

### Decisions (carried into v2.0)

- Production runs on port 3002 via `npm start -- --port 3002`; kill existing: `lsof -ti :3002 | xargs kill -9`
- After any build change: rebuild with `npm run build` then restart
- **Vector store architecture (CRITICAL):** QMD handles BM25/lexical only. ALL vector/semantic search uses Qdrant Cloud. `qmd embed` is FORBIDDEN.
- **Security:** No `execSync`/`exec` — use `execFileSync` or pure `fs/promises` only
- **mem0 writes:** Only via `POST http://localhost:3201/memory/add` — never touch `agent_memory` Qdrant directly
- **Group children:** Use `parentId` + `extent:'parent'` pattern (Phase 17 — already in codebase)
- **Qdrant stays cloud:** Never add local Qdrant to Docker compose — configured via QDRANT_URL + QDRANT_API_KEY env vars
- **Docker compose is for OSS users only:** Luis keeps native workflow (npm start, LaunchAgent, port 3002)
- **Memory stack is fixed for v2.0:** mem0 + Qdrant Cloud (vector) + Neo4j (graph, new) + SQLite (episodic). No pluggability until v3.0.

### v2.0 architectural constraints

- **LangGraph runs as a Python service** — separate process from Next.js, same pattern as Pipecat voice service
- **LangGraph checkpoint DB is `data/orchestration.db`** — SEPARATE from Memroos's main SQLite DB to avoid cross-process lock contention
- **A2A adapter and LangGraph are separate layers** — A2A owns transport/protocol/task-state mapping; LangGraph owns routing policy, capability selection, retry, HIL. They communicate via internal API (ORCH-07 contract)
- **REG-00 canonical registry is complete** — A2A and REST registration both write through the same model
- **Phase 35 A2A layer is complete** — agent cards, A2A registration, durable task APIs, SSE, outbound delegation, ADK fixture, Registry/Flow surfacing
- **A2A adapter routing is protocol-driven** — `protocol: a2a` selects A2A; platform alone does not reroute legacy Gemini agents
- **Outbound A2A credentials are env-key-only** — metadata may name an env var, but UI must not render bearer/API-key values or raw auth headers
- **ADK proof fixture is optional** — `examples/adk-a2a-agent/` is not imported by Memroos startup

### v2.5 ACTUAL Status (reconciliation audit 2026-05-16)

Prior STATE.md claimed "all 6 phases shipped" — that was FALSE. No SUMMARY.md
exists for any phase; all work is uncommitted; production build is broken.
Verdict: coherent partial work (real logic, not scaffolding), NOT shippable.

| Phase | Name | Actual Status |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 57 | Eval Engine Core | PARTIAL — engine/scorers/judge real; golden set ~3/50 rows |
| 58 | SEAL Self-Improvement | PARTIAL — full loop coded; 4 real test failures (audit FK, eval lookups) |
| 59 | Memory Autogen | UNPLANNED — code exists, NO phase dir/plan/contract |
| 60 | Agent Autogen | PARTIAL/MISSING — golden sets 2/50 each; no dogfood W-lift evidence |
| 61 | Business-Ops L3 | PARTIAL — schema/code column mismatch will break L3 at runtime |
| 62 | Public Eval API + SDK | PARTIAL — SDKs real, route paths diverge from plan |

Scope creep outside v2.5: phases 63 (Rename+Team Auth) & 64 (Immutable Audit+HIL)
have plan dirs + code (lib/auth/, /api/auth/, login/register) — v3 direction.
| Phase 70-foundation-engine-core P05 | 11 minutes | 3 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 70-foundation-engine-core P03 | 35m | 3 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 71-recall-hil-sla-voice P03 | 8 | 3 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 72-cross-project-recall-behavioral-w-lift-ui-skills P01 | 6m | 3 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 72 P02 | 15m | 3 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 72 P04 | 40m | 3 tasks | 6 files |
| Phase 72 P05 | 36m | 3 tasks | 7 files |
| Phase 72 P06 | 12m | 3 tasks | 4 files |

### Blockers/Concerns (verified)

- **BUILD BROKEN:** new untracked `apps/memroos/src/middleware.ts` (auth, ph63/64)
  collides with `proxy.ts`. This Next.js replaced middleware→proxy; the two files
  hold *different* logic (RBAC vs host-redirect) and must be merged, not deleted.

- **91/545 tests fail** (25 files): SEAL audit-log FK bug, L3 schema mismatch,
  plus mock-setup failures (hive lineage, memory tier routes).

- Golden sets ~4% populated — drift guard / agreement criteria cannot be validated.
- `bcryptjs` declared in package.json but may need `npm install`.
- `.codex/` & `.agents/` untracked tool state — should be gitignored, NOT committed.
- GitNexus embeddings partial (285/473) — upstream crash bug (abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus#824)

### v2.5 Finishing Pass (2026-05-16) — what closed

- ✅ **Golden sets populated** (minimal viable): 57 business-ops 16 rows, 60
  sales/support/finance/ops 15 each. Verified vs real judge — drift agreement
  ≥0.85 with positive + policy-leak negative classes. Reproducible via
  `golden-sets/.generate.mjs`. Full ~50-row sets still a future nice-to-have.

- ✅ **Path/naming ratified** as-built for 61 (`lib/l3`) and 62
  (`/api/public/v1/*`) via plan amendments — rename deferred to external
  packaging. No longer open.

- ✅ **Phase 59 retro-documented** — PLAN + PARTIAL SUMMARY authored; all 6
  MEMGEN reqs implemented + tested.

### v2.5 Tier 1 closure (2026-05-16)

- ✅ **Dogfood W-lift closed at Tier 1:** `EvalService.rescoreForProposal`
  now uses `lib/seal/rescore.ts` to run deterministic modeled post-apply
  re-scoring through the real eval engine, golden-set loader, layer scorers,
  judge, drift guard, persistence, and SEAL audit metadata. Keep and rollback
  are both reachable without a mocked eval service.

- ✅ **Honesty guardrail preserved:** memory/config proposal classes can move W
  via the modeled fixed-harness delta. `agent_instruction_patch`,
  `skill_addition`, and `noop_test` keep W unchanged with `wLiftModeled:false`.
  True behavioral W-lift from instruction/skill changes remains v3.

- Phase 59 scope classification closed as v2.5 retro-documented; behavioral
  instruction/skill W-lift remains v3 scope

- Auth/63/64 code kept on main (build depends on it); tracked as v3 in ROADMAP

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-05-24
Stopped at: v5.0 roadmap created (phases 74-82). 41 requirements mapped 100%.
Resume file: None
Next action: `/gsd:plan-phase 74` — Security Label Schema + Raw Vault (foundation of security critical path).

## UAT Findings (2026-05-17)

- **Root cause fixed:** `apps/memroos/.env.local` was missing `MEMROOS_JWT_SECRET`, `MEMROOS_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `MEMROOS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. These live in root `.env` which Next.js doesn't load. Added to `.env.local` (gitignored).
- **Tenant API key mismatch:** `tak-default-internal` hash was stale. Updated to match current `MEMROOS_OPERATOR_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.
- **All 18 pages 200 OK**, 680 tests passing, eval engine E2E verified (W=0.7035), public API functional.
